For a robot to be able to assist us in our daily lives, it is not feasible to train each robot for a large number of tasks with all instances of objects that exist in human environments. Robots will have to generalize their skills by jointly reasoning with various sensor modalities such as vision, language and haptic feedback. This is an extremely challenging problem because each modality has intrinsically different statistical properties. Moreover, even with expert knowledge, manually designing joint features between such disparate modalities is difficult.
In this dissertation, we focus on developing learning algorithms for robots that model tasks involving interactions with various objects in unstructured human environments --- especially on novel objects and scenarios that involve sequences of complicated manipulation. To this end, we develop algorithms that learn shared representations of multimodal data and model full sequences of complex motions. We demonstrate our approach on several different applications: understanding human activities in unstructured environment, synthesizing manipulation sequences for under-specified tasks, manipulating novel appliances, and manipulating objects with haptic feedback."

Recent discoveries have implicated circulating TMAO as a candidate risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) among patients, but whether TMAO and dietary choline play a causative role in the disease process remains controversial. This dissertation describes 1) the production of TMAO from its dietary precursors (TMAO, choline and L-carnitine) in healthy individuals, 2) its metabolic fate within the body, and 3) the relationship between dietary choline and high blood pressure, a major risk factor for CVD.    In Chapter 1, a randomized crossover feeding study was conducted where 40 healthy men consumed a test meal consisting of either fish (TMAO), eggs (choline), beef (choline and L-carnitine) or a fruit control. Postprandial blood collected for 6 hours after consumption of the test meal revealed that fish consumption yielded the highest increase in plasma TMAO metabolites among the test meals. Furthermore, production of TMAO following consumption of eggs or beef varied among individuals and correlated with the gut microbiome. The overall findings show that TMAO can be temporarily elevated in healthy individuals following consumption of various foods, especially heart-healthy fish. High variation in plasma TMAO in response to the same meals indicates metabolic differences among individuals that may be due to other factors such as composition of the gut microbiome.    In Chapter 2, the metabolic fate of dietary TMAO was investigated. Participants enrolled in the feeding study consumed 50 mg deuterium-labeled methyl d9-TMAO (d9-TMAO) in the fruit control arm. We found that d9-TMAO entered circulation within 15 min and that 96% of the tracer was excreted in urine within 24 hours. These results demonstrate rapid absorption of intact TMAO along with its efficient elimination from the human body.    In Chapter 3 the hypothesis that increased choline intake may increase CVD risk through elevated blood pressure was investigated. Using cross-sectional 2007-10 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we examined the relationship of choline intake with blood pressure and prevalence odds of hypertension in a general U.S. population. We found a borderline inverse association between choline intake and odds of hypertension in women but not in men. Furthermore, supplemental choline use by both sexes showed a significant inverse association with hypertension. We concluded that choline intake is not associated with blood pressure, a risk factor of CVD, in this population.    Taken together, evidence in this dissertation does not support the hypothesis that dietary choline increases disease risks by elevating baseline circulating TMAO in healthy adults. More epidemiologic and experimental evidence are still needed to further confirm or dispute this hypothesis.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:14Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Traditional energy management techniques have been either reactive or locally predictive at best. These schemes often underperform, by either failing to meet the desired performance target or consuming excess energy. Moreover, different applications and environments create a diverse set of challenges. Therefore, there is a dire need to develop new techniques that approach energy-performance optimality under stringent and diverse application and environmental conditions.
In this dissertation, we propose proactive management techniques for Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) in smart buildings, and for dynamic power management of heterogeneous processors. We show how the lack of future visibility and adaptivity of traditional energy management techniques proposed in these two domains degrades energy and performance. We develop proactive techniques to improve energy efficiency in buildings and processors. 
We first focus on building energy management. We propose to automatically assign meetings to rooms to reduce overall energy consumption. We derive an HVAC energy model for meeting assignment by characterizing building energy behavior. Using this energy model, we propose several assignment algorithms, and analyze their optimality and scalability. We also characterize how different factors impact energy savings, when it is worthwhile to use complex assignment algorithms, and when simpler methods suffice. We further extend this model to include weather factors, and develop a methodology for assigning meetings to the most appropriate room given the expected weather. 
We then propose to apply Model Predictive Control (MPC) to dynamically balance HVAC energy consumption and occupant comfort. Traditional energy management techniques ignore past discomfort behavior and therefore poorly trade off energy for comfort. Our MPC framework uses a probabilistic model to predict the upcoming occupancy and discomfort history, in order to adaptively balance energy consumption and occupant comfort. Our approach achieves high energy efficiency while operating within a specified discomfort target.
For heterogeneous processors, we propose MPC-based dynamic General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) power management. Traditional schemes ignore future kernel behavior, and may degrade performance and energy efficiency due to their inability to plan for the performance and energy characteristics of future phases. Our approach proactively configures hardware states based on recent execution history, the pattern of upcoming kernels, and the predicted behavior of those kernels, and adaptively varies its future visibility in order to achieve high energy savings with negligible performance impact and overhead.
We extend this framework for workloads that use the CPU and the GPU concurrently. Our MPC approach simultaneously optimizes the CPU and GPU across adaptively-managed time windows consisting of multiple phases of CPU and GPU applications. We explore several alternatives that trade off future visibility for computational overhead, and demonstrate significant energy savings over current state-of-the-art approaches."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:23Z (GMT).

The tight confinement of light inside these chips greatly enhances light-matter interactions, making this an ideal platform for nonlinear photonics. Recently, microresonator-based Kerr frequency comb generation has become a prevalent emerging field, enabling the generation of a broadband optical pulse train by inputting a low-power continuous-wave laser into a low-loss chip-scale micro-cavity. These chip-scale combs have a wide variety of applications, including optical clocks, optical spectroscopy, and data communications. Several important applications in biological, chemical and atmospheric areas require combs generated in the visible and mid-infrared wavelength ranges, where there has been far less research and development compared with the near-infrared. Additionally, most platforms widely for combs are passive, limiting the ability to control and optimize the frequency combs.
In this dissertation, we set out to address these shortcomings and introduce new tunability as well as wavelength flexibility in order to enable new applications for microresonator frequency combs. The silicon nitride platform for near-infrared combs is generally a passive platform with limited tuning capabilities. We overcome dispersion limitations in the visible range by leveraging the second-order nonlinearity of silicon nitride and demonstrate visible comb lines. We then further investigate the second-order nonlinearity of silicon nitride by measuring the linear electro-optic effect, a potential tuning mechanism. Finally, we introduce thermal tuning onto the silicon nitride platform and demonstrate tuning of the resonance extinction and dispersion of a micro-cavity using a coupled cavity design. We also address the silicon mid-infrared frequency comb platform. The transparency range of the traditional silicon platform prohibits operation beyond 4 um wavelength. Here we show that a silicon photonics platform can be leveraged for broadband mid-infrared operation without introducing complexity in fabrication. Both an air-clad and fully suspended silicon platform can enable broadband, low-loss propagation and comb generation as high as 6 um. We demonstrate a high quality factor resonator near 4 um wavelength, more than an order of magnitude higher than the traditional platform. Finally, we discuss future avenues of research building on the work presented here."					"Made available in DSpace on 2018-01-18T18:55:26Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The potential for achieving learning outcomes in citizen science is great, but there is a need to first understand what those potential learning outcomes are and how they have been studied within the field. Further, engagement in citizen science can take many forms and it is argued that deeper engagement with the science process yields deeper learning outcomes. However, few studies have examined engagement deeply and fewer still across multiple projects. The ways in which people engage in citizen science and how their engagement relates to learning, is largely unknown. 
Using a mixed methods comparative case study approach, this research first describes an empirically derived conceptual model for articulating learning outcomes within citizen science that includes the following constructs: interest in science and the environment; efficacy for learning/doing science and environmental action; motivation for learning/doing science and environmental action; understanding of the Nature of Science; skills related to science inquiry; and environmental stewardship. Next, five dimensions of engagement‚Äîmotivation, behavioral, cognitive, affective and social‚Äîare explored qualitatively through interviews with 72 citizen science participants from six different projects.

Aggregated across the dataset, the three most common project activities include: gathering data, submitting data, and sharing information about the project with others. Quantitative data analysis reveals that higher levels of reported behavioral engagement has a positive, statistically significant relationship with self-perceived skills of science inquiry.

However, there exists a noticeable gap between theory and practice. On one hand, a simple algorithm like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) works very well in practice, without satisfactory theoretical explanations. On the other hand, the algorithms analyzed in the theoretical machine learning literature, although with solid guarantees, tend to be less efficient compared with the techniques widely used in practice, which are usually hand tuned or ad hoc based on intuition.  This dissertation is about bridging the gap between theory and practice from two directions. The first direction is "practice to theory", i.e., to explain and analyze the existing algorithms and empirical observations in machine learning. Along this direction, we provide  sufficient conditions for SGD to escape saddle points and local minima, as well as SGD dynamics analysis for the two-layer neural network with ReLU activation.  The other direction is "theory to practice", i.e., using theoretical tools to obtain new, better and practical algorithms. Along this direction, we introduce a new algorithm Harmonica that uses Fourier analysis and compressed sensing for tuning hyperparameters. Harmonica supports parallel sampling and works well for tuning neural networks with more than 30 hyperparameters.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:15Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

As such, the controls on the composition and activity of this community and, in particular, the role of plant species and genotypes shaping community composition and activity is a subject of ongoing research with important implications for plant breeding and agricultural management.  This dissertation seeks to understand the extent of plant genotype driven variation in rhizosphere bacterial community composition within maize (Zea mays subsp mays) and among species of summer annuals characteristic of agricultural fields. In three field experiments a common garden experimental design is combined with measures of plant growth and nitrogen acquisition, profiling of bacterial community composition (BCC) via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and measures of potential extracellular enzyme activity to test hypotheses that: 1) plant variation in rhizosphere BCC is predicted by plant evolutionary history, 2) plant variation in growth and nitrogen economy influences rhizosphere BCC, and 3) historical selection for yield in fertilized production systems has altered maize rhizosphere bacterial community assembly and plant N acquisition efficiencies. We find that plant species differentially select rhizosphere bacterial communities and that the magnitude of variation is related to both plant phylogeny and variation in growth and nitrogen economy.  Intraspecific variation in rhizosphere BCC between genotypes within a plant species is also observed, but these differences are of lower magnitude and not well described by either functional variation or overall genetic distance between genotypes.  Secondly, we observe that temporal variation in rhizosphere assembly and activity closely parallels temporal variation in plant growth and nitrogen uptake, which further highlights the link between plant function and plant rhizosphere effects.  Finally, our results indicate that breeding has improved nitrogen uptake efficiency of maize hybrids but has not resulted in a parallel change in rhizosphere BCC.  The implications of these patterns of variation in rhizosphere BCC are discussed in respect to agroecosystem management and plant breeding.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:24Z (GMT).

Smith Einarson, Margaret Elizabeth||Buckley, Daniel H.	2018-10-03T18:40:34Z	2018-10-03T18:40:34Z		12/30/17		Plants interact with diverse microbial communities in the rhizosphere that serve as a critical link mediating soil nutrient cycling and plant nutrient supply.  As such, the controls on the composition and activity of this community and, in particular, the role of plant species and genotypes shaping community composition and activity is a subject of ongoing research with important implications for plant breeding and agricultural management.  This dissertation seeks to understand the extent of plant genotype driven variation in rhizosphere bacterial community composition within maize (Zea mays subsp mays) and among species of summer annuals characteristic of agricultural fields. In three field experiments a common garden experimental design is combined with measures of plant growth and nitrogen acquisition, profiling of bacterial community composition (BCC) via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and measures of potential extracellular enzyme activity to test hypotheses that: 1) plant variation in rhizosphere BCC is predicted by plant evolutionary history, 2) plant variation in growth and nitrogen economy influences rhizosphere BCC, and 3) historical selection for yield in fertilized production systems has altered maize rhizosphere bacterial community assembly and plant N acquisition efficiencies. We find that plant species differentially select rhizosphere bacterial communities and that the magnitude of variation is related to both plant phylogeny and variation in growth and nitrogen economy.  Intraspecific variation in rhizosphere BCC between genotypes within a plant species is also observed, but these differences are of lower magnitude and not well described by either functional variation or overall genetic distance between genotypes.  Secondly, we observe that temporal variation in rhizosphere assembly and activity closely parallels temporal variation in plant growth and nitrogen uptake, which further highlights the link between plant function and plant rhizosphere effects.  Finally, our results indicate that breeding has improved nitrogen uptake efficiency of maize hybrids but has not resulted in a parallel change in rhizosphere BCC.  The implications of these patterns of variation in rhizosphere BCC are discussed in respect to agroecosystem management and plant breeding.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:40:34Z (GMT).

New methods to control polymerization and assembly in higher dimensions are now being demonstrated. Here we highlight the use of a new class of polymeric materials called covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to obtain and rationally design higher dimensional structures (Chapter 1). Traditional polymer syntheses, isolation, and processing technique are not often well suited or optimized for these materials yet. We investigate the advantages afforded the synthesis of these material as crystalline and oriented thin films on substrates from a flowed solution (Chapter 2). The ability to rationally-design these materials for specific applications is also investigated. We design and synthesize firstgeneration materials for photon upconversion in COFs and refine the design criteria for second generation material (Chapter 3). Lastly, we turn to the functionalization of the surface of single layers of 2D materials. While functionalization of interfaces is not a new field, the remarkable properties of single layer 2D materials has expanded the scope of this field to these fundamentally inert interfaces. New chemistry to functionalize these surfaces, specifically metal dichalcogenides, is considered (Chapter 4).			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:16Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Thiamin is an essential vitamin necessary for all life, however, how bacteria shape the ecological interactions between organisms for this nutrient is not well understood. We employed a Drosophila melanogaster-microbiota model utilizing a chemically defined diet to understand the interaction between how the host is influenced by the microbiota‚Äôs interaction with the dietary component thiamin. We found that the Drosophila melanogaster microbiota provisions thiamin to its host in a low thiamin environment. This provision rescued development of Drosophila on a no thiamin diet, as axenic flies were unable to develop on this diet. Our study was a clear demonstration supporting the long standing hypothesis that animal microbiotas function to provision thiamin and other vitamins to their host. A small subset of bacteria produce the enzyme thiaminase I, which degrades thiamin to its two moieties. The biological function of this enzyme is not understood. We used a genomic approach to investigate a potential function of this enzyme and found that it is located in a conserved operon in three thiaminase I producing Paenibacillus species, with other genes involved in thiamin salvage and production of the thiamin antimetabolite bacimethrin, suggesting it may play a role in thiamin salvage and competition for this nutrient. We further investigated the biological role of thiaminase I using Burkholderia thailandensis, where we generated thiamin auxotrophs. We found that the enzyme plays a role in thiamin salvage as it allows for auxotrophic strains to grow in media conditions when strains lacking thiaminase I cannot, as it recycles precursors from thiamin and certain analogs. Using a genomic approach, we also investigated the biosynthetic and metabolic potential of the unique, giant bacterial intestinal symbiont ‚ÄòCandidatus Epulopiscium viviparous‚Äô of the surgeonfish Naso tonganus. We found that this bacterium‚Äôs genome is enriched for carbohydrate metabolism, as it has the potential to degrade a vast array of carbohydrates present in its host‚Äôs diet, allowing them to supply assimilable nutrients, vitamins, and protein to their host.		12/18/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:40:35Z (GMT).

Although several dozen chloroplast proteases are known, information concerning their substrates and functions is limited. In particular, little is known about the structural features of substrates that trigger their proteolysis. Most chloroplast proteins are nuclear encoded and are targeted through an N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide (cTP) that is removed by stromal processing peptidase (SPP). To better understand proteolytic maturation, the soluble N-terminal proteome of the Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplast was characterized. A cTP cleavage motif was observed that suggests other peptidases, in addition to SPP, are involved in chloroplast protein maturation. There was a clear preference for small uncharged amino acids at the processed protein N-terminus suggesting the existence of a chloroplast specific ‚ÄòN-end rule‚Äô. The soluble chloroplast peptidases PREP and OOP have been shown to degrade small polypeptides in vitro and are thought to be responsible for removal of cTP fragments and other degradation products. The CLP protease system can degrade intact protein substrates with the aid of ATP dependent (AAA+) CLPC chaperones that unfold and feed substrates into the CLP proteolytic core. An array of proteomic tools were used to compare Arabidopsis mutants deficient in the above peptidases with wild type. Degradation products, including cTPs, were found to accumulate in peptidase mutants indicative, of rate-limited or blocked degradation pathways. Incomplete or altered N-terminal maturation for chloroplast proteins was dependent on the type and severity of the peptidase deficiency. These results provide molecular details to help explain dwarf, chlorotic mutant phenotypes and demonstrate the interplay between protein import, proteolytic processing and the downstream degradation of damaged or unwanted proteins in the chloroplast. Substrate and sequence cleavage specificity was determined for soluble chloroplast glutamyl-endopeptidase (CGEP) and the plastoglobule localized metallopeptidase PGM48. Structural models were used to predict peptidase substrate binding mechanisms.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:26Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The SidE family of Legionella effector proteins has been shown to modify target proteins via a novel ubiquitination pathway, in which phosphoribosyl-ubiquitin is generated and subsequently used to ubiquitinate proteins. To elucidate the biochemical mechanism of this novel modification, we have solved the crystal structure of the catalytic core of SidE family member, SdeA. Using biochemical activity assays, we discovered an unpredicted domain that is crucial for the first step of this novel modification. To elucidate the molecular mechanism, we co-crystallized another SidE family member, SdeD, with both unmodified and modified ubiquitin molecules. These structural studies gave insights into the mechanism of ubiquitin modification during the second step of the reaction. We have also shown that two of the small SidE family members, SdeD and SdeF, remove the SdeA ubiquitin modification in an activity dependent manner, thus functioning as a deubiquitinase towards SdeA target proteins. These deubiquitinase proteins have also been shown to revert the phenotype exerted by SdeA in host cells. Altogether, this work provides a mechanistic insight into a novel ubiquitination reaction catalyzed by SdeA, in addition to providing a preliminary model for regulation of this enzymatic activity.		12/4/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:17Z (GMT).

I reviewed literature about conservation-related applications of Rare‚Äôs Theory of Change (TOC) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). I found that each of these two theories was useful on some level in addressing conservation behaviors. Next, I employed Rare‚Äôs TOC to assess a social marketing campaign (SMC) geared towards inducing people to report poaching more frequently. The SMC apparently did not affect an increase, but rather seemed to result in a decrease in poaching reporting, possibly because the SMC may have raised additional questions related to poaching enforcement and other issues. Also, the SMC did not appear to affect people‚Äôs environmental knowledge, attitude to report poaching, and perceived barriers to reporting, all considered pre-stages to changing people‚Äôs conservation related behavior. As similar changes in attitudes and perceived barriers occurred in both treatment and control areas, there is a possibility that communication between people from these areas obscured results or, that a third variable (e.g. time, politics) led to this change, and the SMC had nothing to do with it. I also investigated the utility of applying TPB in determining local people‚Äôs intentions to report poaching, as well as determining how TPB constructs related to each other according to the model. While some of the TPB constructs related to each other according to the model, other constructs did not, and TPB ultimately failed to predict people‚Äôs intention to report poaching. Family size emerged as an important factor correlated with reporting poaching, as it perhaps reflects socio-economic differences and/or factors relating to social network size. Overall, people may have perceived possible costs of reporting poaching, such as upsetting community members, to be greater than potential benefits, such as monetary rewards. Implications of social network size and perhaps interpersonal communication need to be better understood to increase effectiveness of future conservation initiatives in NEPL NPA. Such conservation initiatives should involve employing SMC alternatives, such as engaging entire communities in reporting-poaching, supplementing cognitive with technical approaches to reduce poaching, and fostering alternative pro-conservation behaviors that improve people‚Äôs socio-economic situations and thus alleviate poaching pressures.

Specifically, the research seeks to understand the extent to which narrative and participatory drama influence social interaction, attitudes, and efficacy around inter-related sustainability issues among smallholder farmers in Malawi. To test the role of these communication methods, 520 smallholder farmers in two regions of the country participated in an integrated curriculum on climate change, agroecology, soil health, health and nutrition, and social equity in the early summer of 2016. Half of the participants used stories and drama in their training, and the other half acted as a control group using small group discussions without the prompted use of narrative or drama. The findings presented here include qualitative in-depth interviews (N = 47), firsthand observations, and quantitative baseline and follow-up survey data (N = 442). The research draws on communication theories around social and behavioral science, specifically as these theories relate to health, environmental, science, and risk communication. The work is unique in context and scale and also in its consideration of how best to communicate the complex interrelationships between multiple sustainability issues. This research also aims to strengthen communication efforts around sensitive social issues, such as HIV/AIDS, alcoholism, and violence in the household. Findings revealed that the use of narrative and participatory drama within the training served to influence social interaction, attitudes, and efficacy in positive ways. The results also showed that narrative and participatory drama play an important role in engaging and empowering vulnerable groups, including women and those with little or no education. The findings showed increased positive attitudes and efficacy around new ideas relating to environmental conservation and equality, some of which affirmed long-held traditional beliefs and some of which ran counter to those beliefs. Small group discussions also revealed many of the positive benefits of narrative and drama, including increasing engagement and the ability to talk about sensitive subjects for male participants. Both communication methods proved valuable as learning tools around sustainability information, with narrative and drama having the singular benefit of acting as both a learning and a teaching tool for farmers. Participants described the use of participatory drama, in particular, as helping them attract and hold the attention of large groups of farmers (often >200) when sharing information after the training. In this way, these creative and participatory communication methods aid in not only the communication of complex and linked sustainability topics but also making the information itself more sustainable as farmers pass on what they have learned to others. These findings help expand previous research on the use of narrative and drama around health and environmental issues, illustrating the valuable role of these communication methods in helping to tackle some of the world‚Äôs most pressing and complex questions and challenges around long-term planetary health.

As nanoscale materials and atomically sharp interfaces become increasingly technologically relevant, STEM provides feedback on the individual atoms, defects and interfaces that matter in the material. Two areas where STEM characterization is critical for materials advancement are electrochemical energy materials, such as battery electrodes and fuel cell electrocatalysts, and complex oxide materials, which exhibit a diverse array of properties.
Electrochemical energy systems, including battery electrodes and electrocatalysts for fuel cells, are critical for the future of clean transportation. For these materials, investigation of the nanoscale processes which occur in liquid electrolytes is critical for understanding their performance in real devices. Encapsulating a thin layer of liquid in the TEM for in situ characterization is an exciting approach for gaining a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms of energy conversion and storage. The first half of this dissertation discusses the development and use of liquid-cell and electrochemical-cell TEM. First, I discuss the limitations and opportunities of EELS in thick liquids. I further discuss an electrochemical cell for the TEM, and its application to fuel cell electrocatalysts and battery materials. I was able to observe Pt-Ni octahedral catalyst particles degrade and lose their shape, and detect lithium ions move in a charging and discharging battery cathode (LiFePO4) with nanoscale detail by mapping the electronic structure.
The second part of the dissertation focuses on complex oxides, which host a wide range of electronic and magnetic properties. Oxide interfaces, such as thin-film heterostructures and domain walls, are often atomically abrupt and produce novel functionalities. In particular, ferroelectric domain walls are rich sources of emergent phenomena ‚Äì such as two-dimensional conductive sheets that form in an otherwise insulating solid ‚Äì due to their unusual electronic properties or symmetry breaking. We probed how ferroelectric distortions change at domain walls with STEM for ErMnO3. From the STEM images, we calculated the order parameter at many domain walls in ErMnO3 to create a statistical picture of the ferroelectricity at these topological defects, and also observed how the order parameter changes near vortex structures. We further apply these methods to lutetium ferrite superlattices, where we use feedback from STEM to design a near-room-temperature multiferroic material in which ferroelectricity enhances the magnetism. We find that there are confined charged domain walls in the superlattice that additionally boost magnetism."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:27Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Specifically, the research seeks to understand the extent to which narrative and participatory drama influence social interaction, attitudes, and efficacy around inter-related sustainability issues among smallholder farmers in Malawi. To test the role of these communication methods, 520 smallholder farmers in two regions of the country participated in an integrated curriculum on climate change, agroecology, soil health, health and nutrition, and social equity in the early summer of 2016. Half of the participants used stories and drama in their training, and the other half acted as a control group using small group discussions without the prompted use of narrative or drama. The findings presented here include qualitative in-depth interviews (N = 47), firsthand observations, and quantitative baseline and follow-up survey data (N = 442). The research draws on communication theories around social and behavioral science, specifically as these theories relate to health, environmental, science, and risk communication. The work is unique in context and scale and also in its consideration of how best to communicate the complex interrelationships between multiple sustainability issues. This research also aims to strengthen communication efforts around sensitive social issues, such as HIV/AIDS, alcoholism, and violence in the household. Findings revealed that the use of narrative and participatory drama within the training served to influence social interaction, attitudes, and efficacy in positive ways. The results also showed that narrative and participatory drama play an important role in engaging and empowering vulnerable groups, including women and those with little or no education. The findings showed increased positive attitudes and efficacy around new ideas relating to environmental conservation and equality, some of which affirmed long-held traditional beliefs and some of which ran counter to those beliefs. Small group discussions also revealed many of the positive benefits of narrative and drama, including increasing engagement and the ability to talk about sensitive subjects for male participants. Both communication methods proved valuable as learning tools around sustainability information, with narrative and drama having the singular benefit of acting as both a learning and a teaching tool for farmers. Participants described the use of participatory drama, in particular, as helping them attract and hold the attention of large groups of farmers (often >200) when sharing information after the training. In this way, these creative and participatory communication methods aid in not only the communication of complex and linked sustainability topics but also making the information itself more sustainable as farmers pass on what they have learned to others. These findings help expand previous research on the use of narrative and drama around health and environmental issues, illustrating the valuable role of these communication methods in helping to tackle some of the world‚Äôs most pressing and complex questions and challenges around long-term planetary health.

Gainor, J Ellen||Levitt, Bruce A||Feldshuh, David M.	2018-10-22T17:22:17Z	2018-10-22T17:22:17Z		5/30/18		This dissertation draws upon five years‚Äô work as a volunteer teaching artist in the Auburn Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in Upstate New York, where I have co-facilitated a company of incarcerated poets and performers, the Phoenix Players Theatre Group. ‚ÄúCagecraft‚Äù is my term for the process of making theatre in response to imprisonment, a concept that I employ to study a range of modern and contemporary performances made with, by, and about incarcerated peoples. I examine photographs of a 1908 prison performance by Buffalo Bill‚Äôs Wild West Show alongside the Edison Company‚Äôs film Execution of Czolgosz with Panorama of Auburn Prison (1901); the dramaturgy of playwright Naomi Wallace; and a collaboration between conceptual artist Jackie Sumell and Herman Wallace‚Äîa Black Panther and one of the ‚ÄúAngola 3,‚Äù who was incarcerated in solitary confinement for over 40 years.  In the case of the Phoenix Players, cagecraft denotes physical theatre techniques used to create a space in which the men feel empowered to share personal narratives, which form the basis of collectively devised performances for an invited audience. Cagecraft, I argue, catalyzes the occasion for incarcerated artists to be witnessed as full human beings, an experience that has transformative effects individually and socially. Central to this study is a theory of the ‚Äúcarceral subject,‚Äù which characterizes a contingent state of capture and bondage that coalesces most dramatically on the minoritarian and subaltern. To be recognized as a person entails surrendering to a cage made from an individualizing network of social, cultural, and institutional traumas, structured by the assemblage of the prison. Through cagecraft, I argue, carceral subjects can interrupt trauma, enacting utopian, world-making gestures from behind bars. I conclude that cagecraft has the power to liberate actors and audiences, at least in the moment of performance, because artists re-make themselves and therefore re-make the world.

During this period visual artists produced artworks and scholars posited arguments characteristic of postcolonial imagination whose contemporary qualities demonstrated a shift away from the culture of resistance to that of innovative expressions and expanded subject matter. There also emerged contentions that evidenced the complexity of the transition from apartheid to democracy. 
Working with local discourses (by Njabulo Ndebele and Albie Sachs) preoccupied with a liberated imagination from the stranglehold of apartheid as well as global postcolonial theories (of C.L.R. James, Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, Gayatri Spivak and Homi Bhabha) on the aforementioned themes, this study presents six chapters.
The introductory chapter maps out a theoretical framework and contextual background of the study and articulates the meaning of postcolonial imaginary. Chapter 1 reads Johannes Phokela‚Äôs oil paintings as a postcolonial critique of (art) history‚Äôs Eurocentrism and his visual rewriting of such history by inserting black subjects into colonial master narratives from which they were omitted, obliterated and misrepresented. Chapter 2 examines Zwelethu Mthethwa‚Äôs color photographs through which he proclaims to restore the dignity of black subjects surviving in the margins of postcolonial modernity. Chapter 3 is a critique of Peet Pienaar‚Äôs performance artwork which appropriates a Xhosa male initiation ritual and subjects a black female medical doctor to circumcise him in an art gallery. Chapter 4 reflects on Liese van der Watt‚Äôs call for post-identity, post-race and post-black. The concluding chapter reads the work of Phokela, Mthethwa, Pienaar and van der Watt in light of postcolonial desires: yearning and searching for something different from that which colonial apartheid has constructed and imposed on the South African imagination."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:28Z (GMT).

At small scales, timing non-idealities of clock signals is of interest. As clock speeds become higher and higher in modern circuits, non-idealities such as clock duty-cycle, clock skew and jitter become proportionally large. Therefore, on-chip characterization of the clock using low power is important. A stochastic technique for on-chip measurement of such non-idealities is introduced. The technique uses a simple noisy oscillator to perform random sampling, allows easy integration in a CMOS process and is a promising alternative to direct measurement. Theoretical analysis proving the accuracy and robustness of the technique is presented. An implementation in CMOS 65nm process, occupying an active area of 0.015 mm2 and consuming 0.89 mW, achieves a root mean square error of 0.1 ps and 0.31 ps in externally referenced and self-referenced jitter measurements respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the stochastic technique is the only fully on-chip jitter measurement technique that does not require post processing to obtain the jitter amplitude. 
At large scales, this work explores a technique to achieve and maintain low-power synchronization of long-range peer-to-peer (P2P) RF system. Once synchronized, radio nodes can achieve significant power savings by turning off the RF front-end most of the time. Such aggressive duty-cycling allows battery operated radio to directly communicate over long range, enabling a variety of applications, such as IoT devices that do not strain the existing infrastructure and communication in natural disaster scenarios where infrastructure is unavailable. Existing synchronization techniques for narrowband radio are not scalable to large number of nodes and are often asymmetric (e.g. they require one central node that consumes high power). To solve this problem of scalable, long-range, P2P narrowband radio synchronization, a low-power signal-processor utilizing the pulse coupled oscillator (PCO) scheme for low-latency detection of syncword for aggressive duty-cycling is presented. The signal processor is insensitive to phase and frequency mismatch and compatible with commercial RF front ends. It consumes 5.1 uW in 0.01% duty-cycled mode while detecting a 63-bit syncword at 1.25 Mbps with BER=10-3 at SNR=18.4dB."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:28Z (GMT).

Whole-genome multiplication increases ploidy in whole plants and is broadly associated with increases in cell and organism size. Endoreduplication, which increases ploidy in individual cells, is strongly correlated with increased cell size and nuclear volume. We use the Arabidopsis sepal as a model to study these phenomena.  In my first study, I investigated scaling relationships between ploidy and size by simultaneously quantifying nuclear size, cell size, and organ size in sepals in an isogenic series of diploid, tetraploid, and octoploid plants. We found that pavement cell size increases linearly with ploidy across this series, but organ area increases more modestly due to a compensatory decrease in cell number. Cellular growth rates are similar at all ploidy levels. Likewise, transcriptome size increases with ploidy, and while most genes retain their proportional expression pattern, expression of cell wall-associated genes increases disproportionately with ploidy. We observed that cell size and nuclear size are maintained at a constant ratio; the value of this constant is similar in diploid and tetraploid plants, and slightly lower in octoploid plants. However, cell size is maintained when nuclear size is reduced in the crwn1 mutant, indicating that cell size scales to ploidy rather than nuclear size. These results shed light on how size is regulated in plants and how cells and organisms of differing sizes are generated by ploidy change.  	In my second study, I imaged promoter and protein expression for the SIAMESE-like CDK inhibitor LGO, which controls the entry into endocycles in sepal pavement cells. I found that LGO is broadly transcribed, but that post-transcriptional regulation limits LGO protein to a small number of cells. This expression pattern is consistent with the scattered pattern of endopolyploid cells observed in mature sepals.  	In my third study, I explored variation in sepal cell size patterning in a panel of Brassicaceae species. I found that some, but not all, species had an interspersed pattern of small and large cells on the sepal‚Äôs abaxial surface; sepals with homogeneous cell size did not modulate curvature during anthesis."		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:19Z (GMT).

This goal is shared by many coastal states and has inspired many supportive breeding programs to revitalize native oyster reefs (Crassostrea virginica) in estuaries across the Eastern United States. In some cases, these programs rely on domesticated aquaculture oyster broodstock to supplement populations with hatchery-produced oysters. However, little is known about the long-term efficacy of supportive breeding using domesticated-strain broodstock vs. adults collected from nature. One basic question is about the degree of genetic difference between these two types of oyster compared with spatial differences among natural stocks. In this study, we collected samples from different life stages (juveniles and adults) of eastern oysters from 10 different sites (N=24 per site) in the Hudson River Estuary and compared them with an aquaculture oyster strain recently used for supportive breeding. Population differentiation was tested at a genomic scale with double digest RADseq data. Among natural population samples there was subtle population structure between the Hudson and East Rivers despite the high dispersal potential present during the 2-3 week pelagic larval stage. This contrast between rivers was seen in both spat and adults, and was consistent across two sampling years. The pattern was most strongly manifest in the highest among-population Fst loci, and became recognizable as a spatially discreet pattern of introgression when the aquaculture strain was included in the analysis. The aquaculture strain showed lower genetic variation relative to wild populations. Until fitness consequences of introgression, and relative fitness of wild and aquaculture oysters can be evaluated over the full oyster life cycle, I recommend stricter adherence to published recommendations that wild broodstock be used for generating oyster restoration seed and to avoid mixed plantings that could facilitate interbreeding.		12/31/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:29Z (GMT).

The oxidative stress from an imbalance between reactive oxidants and antioxidants is associated with carcinogenesis and is an important risk factor for breast cancer.  Nrf2, a transcription factor, responds to oxidative and electrophilic stress. However, Nrf2 plays dual roles in carcinogenesis: in normal and premalignant cells, activation of Nrf2 would weaken further oxidation and prevent carcinogenesis; in malignant cells, overexpression of Nrf2 could protect tumor cells from cytotoxic effects of elevated endogenous reactive oxygen species. The beneficial or detrimental effects of Nrf2 also depends on environmental conditions. Ursolic Acid (UA), a natural pentacyclic triterpenoid widely distributed in fruits, herbs and spices, has been reported to have a strong anti-proliferative activity towards human breast cancer cells including malignant MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. However, it is not known whether UA has effects on Nrf2 in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. In this study, UA inhibited the expression of Nrf2 and its phosphorylated form (phosphor S40) p-Nrf2 in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells in whole cells and nucleus. The elevation in NQO1, the Nrf2 downstream antioxidant enzymes, and, the reduction in Keap1, the Nrf2 repressor, were also observed. After a 12 h pretreatment with EGF, the p-EGFR and total cellular and nuclear p-Nrf2 in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were induced but no significant differences were observed in total cellular and nuclear Nrf2 expressions. It may indicate EGFR phosphorylation might be an upstream for p-Nrf2.  Tamoxifen, a selective ER modulator approved drug in the US to reduce breast cancer risk, has been proved to be an effective treatment in metastatic breast cancer and the tamoxifen adjuvant therapy reduced breast cancer recurrence and death. However, the tamoxifen resistance is a critical challenge for the treatment. We compared the constitutive expressions of Nrf2 in ER positive MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cells (MCF-7TamR). Nrf2 and p-Nrf2 were overexpressed in MCF-7TamR cells. Its downstream proteins SOD1 and NQO1 in MCF-7TamR cells was distinctly higher in MCF-7TamR cells than in parental MCF-7 cells. The expression level of Keap1, the cytosolic repressor of Nrf2, was much lower in MCF-7TamR cells. The results suggested that Nrf2/ARE pathway might be therapeutic target to overcome tamoxifen resistance in human breast cancers.  UA significantly inhibited the expression of Nrf2 and its phosphorylated form (phosphor S40) p-Nrf2 in MCF-7 and MCF-7TamR human breast cancer cells. The inhibitory effects of UA on NQO1 and SOD1 were also shown in cells. A stronger anti-proliferative activity against MCF-7TamR cells than parental MCF-7 cells at the concentration of 9 ¬µM and higher was shown. The significant differences in Nrf2 inhibition by UA between MCF-7 and MCF-7TamR cells were also observed. It suggested that the anti-proliferative effect of UA might be accompanied with Nrf2 inhibition in MCF-7 and MCF-7TamR human breast cancer cells according to our findings. Furthermore, the combination of UA plus tamoxifen was demonstrated a synergistic anti-proliferative effect in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, which may suggest that the combined approach of UA and tamoxifen may have greater therapeutic effect on breast cancers than individual compound.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:20Z (GMT).

Any 2D materials can be stacked together, regardless of their crystal structures: this versatility offers an opportunity to realize ‚Äúmaterials by design‚Äù, where, through stacking, film properties can be directly manipulated and film thicknesses can be precisely controlled. In this dissertation, we focus on studying the fabrication, characterization, and application of the stacked 2D systems on a technologically relevant large scale.
We first introduce the growth of wafer-scale homogeneous monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) films using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), a growth technique that enables the fine tuning of precursor kinetics by using gas-phase precursors. After introducing our work on 2D material growth, we switch to 2D stacking and talk about a model 2D stacking system, twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), where twist angle (Œ∏) serves as a key parameter for manipulating the physical properties. We first discuss the Œ∏-dependent properties in tBLG and introduce a vacuum-assisted direct stacking technique that is able to generate high-quality, Œ∏-controllable tBLG using CVD sample sources. We then focus on small-Œ∏ tBLG, where, after presenting a quantitative study of the Œ∏ dependence in its Raman R‚Äô process, we introduce a Œ∏ measurement method that is developed based on these quantitative results. Finally, we utilize this angle detection method to study the Œ∏-dependent electrical properties in small-Œ∏ tBLG. After discussing the 2D stacking model system tBLG, we switch to stacked 2D systems where no apparent changes in properties are introduced by stacking. This kind of stacked system can also have wide applications due to the atomically precise thickness control and well-defined surfaces.

During this period visual artists produced artworks and scholars posited arguments characteristic of postcolonial imagination whose contemporary qualities demonstrated a shift away from the culture of resistance to that of innovative expressions and expanded subject matter. There also emerged contentions that evidenced the complexity of the transition from apartheid to democracy. 
Working with local discourses (by Njabulo Ndebele and Albie Sachs) preoccupied with a liberated imagination from the stranglehold of apartheid as well as global postcolonial theories (of C.L.R. James, Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, Gayatri Spivak and Homi Bhabha) on the aforementioned themes, this study presents six chapters.
The introductory chapter maps out a theoretical framework and contextual background of the study and articulates the meaning of postcolonial imaginary. Chapter 1 reads Johannes Phokela‚Äôs oil paintings as a postcolonial critique of (art) history‚Äôs Eurocentrism and his visual rewriting of such history by inserting black subjects into colonial master narratives from which they were omitted, obliterated and misrepresented. Chapter 2 examines Zwelethu Mthethwa‚Äôs color photographs through which he proclaims to restore the dignity of black subjects surviving in the margins of postcolonial modernity. Chapter 3 is a critique of Peet Pienaar‚Äôs performance artwork which appropriates a Xhosa male initiation ritual and subjects a black female medical doctor to circumcise him in an art gallery. Chapter 4 reflects on Liese van der Watt‚Äôs call for post-identity, post-race and post-black. The concluding chapter reads the work of Phokela, Mthethwa, Pienaar and van der Watt in light of postcolonial desires: yearning and searching for something different from that which colonial apartheid has constructed and imposed on the South African imagination."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:40:39Z (GMT).

At small scales, timing non-idealities of clock signals is of interest. As clock speeds become higher and higher in modern circuits, non-idealities such as clock duty-cycle, clock skew and jitter become proportionally large. Therefore, on-chip characterization of the clock using low power is important. A stochastic technique for on-chip measurement of such non-idealities is introduced. The technique uses a simple noisy oscillator to perform random sampling, allows easy integration in a CMOS process and is a promising alternative to direct measurement. Theoretical analysis proving the accuracy and robustness of the technique is presented. An implementation in CMOS 65nm process, occupying an active area of 0.015 mm2 and consuming 0.89 mW, achieves a root mean square error of 0.1 ps and 0.31 ps in externally referenced and self-referenced jitter measurements respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the stochastic technique is the only fully on-chip jitter measurement technique that does not require post processing to obtain the jitter amplitude. 
At large scales, this work explores a technique to achieve and maintain low-power synchronization of long-range peer-to-peer (P2P) RF system. Once synchronized, radio nodes can achieve significant power savings by turning off the RF front-end most of the time. Such aggressive duty-cycling allows battery operated radio to directly communicate over long range, enabling a variety of applications, such as IoT devices that do not strain the existing infrastructure and communication in natural disaster scenarios where infrastructure is unavailable. Existing synchronization techniques for narrowband radio are not scalable to large number of nodes and are often asymmetric (e.g. they require one central node that consumes high power). To solve this problem of scalable, long-range, P2P narrowband radio synchronization, a low-power signal-processor utilizing the pulse coupled oscillator (PCO) scheme for low-latency detection of syncword for aggressive duty-cycling is presented. The signal processor is insensitive to phase and frequency mismatch and compatible with commercial RF front ends. It consumes 5.1 uW in 0.01% duty-cycled mode while detecting a 63-bit syncword at 1.25 Mbps with BER=10-3 at SNR=18.4dB."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:40:39Z (GMT).

Zhang and Nozick (2018), using the 10% ticket sample, demonstrated that low cost carriers‚Äô post-merger lowered prices for non-stop service post-merger and those reductions in fare were the largest where American Airlines and US Airways were more prominent pre-merger. The paper extends their analysis to include multi-hop service, the impact of hubs and focus cities, and to address the feedback between prices and market concentration by introducing population and income into the statistical models. The estimated models again show that (1) legacy carriers were able to raise prices after the merger and the amount of the increase was larger where American and US Airways played a smaller role in the market pre-merger; and (2) low cost carriers reduced their prices and the amount of the reduction was also heavily influenced by the role that US Airways and American Airlines played in the market pre-merger.  For the legacy carriers these trends have generally increased across 2015, 2016 and 2017.  For the low cost carriers, the reductions in price over these three years have generally decreased.  Finally, we find that where service is provided using airports that are hubs or focus cities, prices are generally higher and that impact is more pronounced in 2016 and 2017 in contrast to 2015.

Hare, Matthew P.	2018-10-03T18:40:40Z			12/30/17		Oyster reefs are one of eleven unique habitats prioritized for restoration in the Hudson River Estuary to improve overall environmental quality and provide society with new and increased benefits from the estuary environment (Miller 2013). This goal is shared by many coastal states and has inspired many supportive breeding programs to revitalize native oyster reefs (Crassostrea virginica) in estuaries across the Eastern United States. In some cases, these programs rely on domesticated aquaculture oyster broodstock to supplement populations with hatchery-produced oysters. However, little is known about the long-term efficacy of supportive breeding using domesticated-strain broodstock vs. adults collected from nature. One basic question is about the degree of genetic difference between these two types of oyster compared with spatial differences among natural stocks. In this study, we collected samples from different life stages (juveniles and adults) of eastern oysters from 10 different sites (N=24 per site) in the Hudson River Estuary and compared them with an aquaculture oyster strain recently used for supportive breeding. Population differentiation was tested at a genomic scale with double digest RADseq data. Among natural population samples there was subtle population structure between the Hudson and East Rivers despite the high dispersal potential present during the 2-3 week pelagic larval stage. This contrast between rivers was seen in both spat and adults, and was consistent across two sampling years. The pattern was most strongly manifest in the highest among-population Fst loci, and became recognizable as a spatially discreet pattern of introgression when the aquaculture strain was included in the analysis. The aquaculture strain showed lower genetic variation relative to wild populations. Until fitness consequences of introgression, and relative fitness of wild and aquaculture oysters can be evaluated over the full oyster life cycle, I recommend stricter adherence to published recommendations that wild broodstock be used for generating oyster restoration seed and to avoid mixed plantings that could facilitate interbreeding.		12/31/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:40:40Z (GMT).

I first review the alpha taxonomy of ‚Ä†Athleta (Volutospina), abundant on either coast of the North Atlantic ocean, and present revised descriptions of 23 species. Cladistic analyses provided a phylogenetic context for subsequent analyses. Two modes of speciation (anagenesis and punctuated equilibrium) are identified in the phylogeny. There was evidence for both modes but punctuated equilibrium was more prevalent than anagenesis within this clade.  In order to document evolution within species, I performed geometric morphometric analyses on five lineages included in the phylogeny. Three evolutionary models were compared on equal footing using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Within this likelihood-based framework, I analyzed landmark-based data for four species, and reanalyzed one well-known putative case of gradualism in the  ‚Ä†A. (V.) petrosus lineage from Eocene deposits of the U.S. Gulf Coastal Plain. These analyses support previous interpretations about evolutionary changes in ‚Ä†A. (V.) petrosus, and confirm the directional nature of shell shape evolution. The four other species analyzed showed unbiased random walks to be most prevalent, for both overall shape (in Procrustes residuals) as well as the first three principle component axes.  Lastly, larval modes (planktotrophic or non-planktotrophic) were identified for each species and evolutionary trends associated with modes of development, when considered in a phylogenetic context, portray a biogeographic story of the clade. The correlation between mode of development, geographic range, and species duration were examined. Test results confirm the hypotheses that species with planktotrophic larvae exhibit longer durations and the correlation between large geographic range and long species duration but do not concur with the hypothesis that species with planktotrophic larvae show wider geographic ranges.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:31Z (GMT).

Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) possess the ability to play a critical role in these applications by interacting with microbiology electrochemically. While most efforts have been aimed at environmental, energy, and chemical production aspects, BESs have demonstrated value as tools for the study of complex microbiomes. Here, I performed work with the goal of developing a BES reactor that could be employed to study hydrogen-gas producing syntrophs to understand their role in critical environments, and further to enrich and isolate syntrophs in pure culture from their microbiome. I first studied poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) as a coating for electrodes to increased BES performance in both large-scale systems and BESs aimed for sensing applications. I then modeled and performed experiments to support the model to understand the complex synergistic interactions of microbes using redox-active mediators to interact with BES electrodes. Finally, I modeled and developed a novel BES architecture to enrich and isolate syntrophs from their microbiome so that they can be studied in pure-culture to understand their role in the environment. My results indicate that the BES architecture, which I built and tested based on modeling, was successful at enriching syntrophs, and indicated further steps that can lead to syntroph isolation.		12/31/22	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:31Z (GMT).

Waite, Geoffrey Carter W||Adelson, Leslie Allen||McBride, Patrizia C.	2018-10-02T20:14:32Z			12/30/17		This dissertation explores literary economies of prose in German-language literature from the 1830s to the early twentieth century, granting particular focus to questions of economic value. The problem of value, this study argues, becomes a central literary concern after the end of the Kunstperiode (Heine) when the question of literature‚Äôs relation to everyday life ‚Äì the central problem of prosaic art ‚Äì turns into a reflection on the value of literature as art, as commodity, as work. While value remains an elusive problem in aesthetic, economic, and moral discourses of the nineteenth and early-twentieth century, literary authors such as Ludwig Tieck, Gottfried Keller, and Robert Walser generate an arsenal of value forms (Marx) that, in different ways, interrogate and shape relations between literature and the world, life and art, work and play, and, most of all, the status of the economic in literary texts. I analyze three value forms in Tieck, Keller, and Walser: lack and surplus; credit and debt; performance (Leistung) and invention. The problem of prose‚Äôs value is literalized in Ludwig Tieck‚Äôs novella Des Lebens √úberflu√ü (1838), which documents how a last-resort Romantic attempt to turn the lack of poetry in a prosaic world into surplus runs up against value‚Äôs sine qua non: finitude or, in Tieck‚Äôs novella, need. I then analyze relations of credit and debt in Gottfried Keller‚Äôs 1874 novella Kleider machen Leute, which, I argue, engages central discussions about what constitutes value in late-nineteenth-century political economy, philosophy, and aesthetics as it reframes the older narrative trope of fortune in terms of a capitalist transfiguration: the risky turn from insolvency to solvency and vice versa. A last chapter argues for a subtype of literary genre, which I call the Leistungsroman, and which I trace specifically to Robert Walser‚Äôs novel Der Geh√ºlfe (1908). Walser‚Äôs novel about clerical work and the insolvency of an entrepreneurial engineer pivots not around the question of Bildung but around the clerical employee‚Äôs (often written) job performance in the context of a division of labor between invention and performance (Leistung). The move to a Leistungsroman enacts a transvaluation of the modern novel, and the values of human and literary innovation and productivity that underwrite it, by reconfiguring the novel‚Äôs relation to work, action, and invention.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:32Z (GMT).

Presented here are several studies at different points on this functional spectrum, with a focus on the crucial regulatory step of promoter proximal pausing. RNA-protein interactions have critical roles in gene regulation.  We adapted an Illumina GAIIx sequencer to make several millions of these measurements with a High-Throughput Sequencing ‚Äì RNA Affinity Profiling (HiTS-RAP) assay.  Millions of cDNAs are sequenced, bound by the E. coli replication terminator protein Tus, and transcribed in situ, whereupon Tus halts transcription leaving RNA stably attached to its template DNA. Binding of fluorescently-labeled protein is then quantified in the sequencer.  By measuring the affinity of mutagenized libraries of an RNA aptamer to NELF-E, an RNA binding subunit of the pausing factor NELF, we show that this interaction is due to a short RNA motif, but the three dimensional structure of the aptamer is critical for its high affinity.  We used this aptamer as an in vivo inhibitor of the interaction between NELF-E and nascent RNA in Drosophila S2 cells.  Pausing was globally reduced, but promoters with the transcription factor GAF were unchanged.  Thus, the interaction between NELF-E and nascent RNA is not critical for pausing when GAF aids NELF recruitment, but is a strong component of NELF recruitment elsewhere. In higher eukaryotes, the timing and level of transcription at gene promoters by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) is specified largely by the sum of information from the promoter itself and from distal enhancers .Transcription widely occurs at enhancers, suggesting Pol II may be a ubiquitous nexus of regulatory signaling. To explore this, we sequenced nascent RNAs at single-molecule resolution to identify Pol II initiation, capping, and pause sites. Our analyses reveal distinct sequence-specified pause classes associated with differences in RNA capping dynamics. Initiation typically occurs within large clusters, especially at gene promoters.  Integrated analysis of nearby chromatin and transcription factors suggests a model of gene regulation in which Pol II initiation provides a biophysical scaffold to create and maintain regulatory domains.		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:21Z (GMT).

SIRT6 is one of the seven mammalian sirtuins and has diverse biological functions such as maintaining genomic stability, controlling glucose homeostasis and suppressing tumor growth. Enzymatically, SIRT6 has been shown to have lysine deacetylation, lysine defatty-acylation and mono-adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyltransferase activities. However, the contribution of each activity to the various functions of SIRT6 is poorly understood.
In Chapter 2, I describe the dissection of functional contribution of the defatty-acylase activity of SIRT6 by utilizing a SIRT6 mutant (Gly60Ala), which has efficient defatty-acylase activity but no detectable deacetylase and mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase activities. Using this mutant, I found that SIRT6‚Äôs defatty-acylase activity regulates the secretion of numerous proteins in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Interestingly, SIRT6 defatty-acylase activity regulates the sorting of many ribosomal proteins into exosomes for secretion.
In Chapter 3, I found that SIRT6 defatty-acylase activity contributes to its tumor suppressor function. To identify SIRT6 defatty-acylation targets, I utilized a fatty acid reporter to metabolically label the proteome followed by affinity enrichment and mass spectrometry analysis. I found that R-Ras2 is a SIRT6 defatty-acylation target that accounts for its tumor suppressor function. Mechanistically, lysine fatty-acylation of R-Ras2 promotes its plasma membrane localization and increases its interaction with PI3K. The increase in R-Ras2 and PI3K association leads to elevated Akt activation and increased cell proliferation.
In Chapter 4, I describe an interactome study of KRas4a and KRas4b, which led to the identification of many previously unknown KRas4a and KRas4b interacting proteins. Interestingly, I found that KRas4a interacts more with Raf1 than KRas4b does, which may contribute to the more anchorage-independent colony formation in KRas4a transformed NIH 3T3 cells than in KRas4b transformed NIH 3T3 cells. Moreover, mTOR was identified as a KRas4a/b interaction protein. Different from well-established mTORC1 and mTORC2, KRas4a/b forms a new mTOR complex without raptor or rictor in cells."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:32Z (GMT).

I first review the alpha taxonomy of ‚Ä†Athleta (Volutospina), abundant on either coast of the North Atlantic ocean, and present revised descriptions of 23 species. Cladistic analyses provided a phylogenetic context for subsequent analyses. Two modes of speciation (anagenesis and punctuated equilibrium) are identified in the phylogeny. There was evidence for both modes but punctuated equilibrium was more prevalent than anagenesis within this clade.  In order to document evolution within species, I performed geometric morphometric analyses on five lineages included in the phylogeny. Three evolutionary models were compared on equal footing using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Within this likelihood-based framework, I analyzed landmark-based data for four species, and reanalyzed one well-known putative case of gradualism in the  ‚Ä†A. (V.) petrosus lineage from Eocene deposits of the U.S. Gulf Coastal Plain. These analyses support previous interpretations about evolutionary changes in ‚Ä†A. (V.) petrosus, and confirm the directional nature of shell shape evolution. The four other species analyzed showed unbiased random walks to be most prevalent, for both overall shape (in Procrustes residuals) as well as the first three principle component axes.  Lastly, larval modes (planktotrophic or non-planktotrophic) were identified for each species and evolutionary trends associated with modes of development, when considered in a phylogenetic context, portray a biogeographic story of the clade. The correlation between mode of development, geographic range, and species duration were examined. Test results confirm the hypotheses that species with planktotrophic larvae exhibit longer durations and the correlation between large geographic range and long species duration but do not concur with the hypothesis that species with planktotrophic larvae show wider geographic ranges.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:40:42Z (GMT).

Extrapolators form beliefs about the probability distribution of future asset prices based on sentiment, which is determined by historical asset prices. Arbitrageurs trade on mispricing but experience the limits of arbitrage, and monopolistic traders hold correct beliefs and market power. Chapter 1 provides a research overview. Chapter 2 presents a discrete-time model and investigates monopolistic traders' optimal strategies. We argue that the equilibrium price is determined not by monopolistic traders' current assets alone, but by the sequence of trades that acquired them. Monopolistic traders' decisions of placing a large block order or sequential small orders depend on both market conditions and other agents' strategies. The pump-and-dump and optimal liquidation strategies offer two examples. Results from this study explain many market phenomena, such as asset price bubbles and flash crashes, which have significant implications for financial institutions. Chapter 3 presents a continuous-time model. The model generates asset pricing characteristics, such as high equity premiums and excess volatility, while maintaining the persistence of risk-free rate and the predictability of dividend price ratio. The model proposes hypotheses and provides theoretical foundations for empirical asset pricing research, and can be used to guide profitable investment strategies.

Providing affordable and reliable service entails the determination of an operating point for the power system, which minimizes the total cost of generation while respecting the physical and operational constraints of the system. At the core of reliability and affordability challenges is the AC optimal power flow problem (AC-OPF). In its most general form, the AC-OPF problem is a high-dimensional  optimization problem that is nonconvex and NP hard in general. In addition to reliability and affordability challenges, in recent years there has been a growing need to develop optimization methods, which enable the reliable and efficient operation of power systems that have a large fraction of their power supplied from intermittent renewable energy resources, like wind and solar. The need to accommodate the intrinsic uncertainty in the power supply of such resources will require the development of robust optimization methods for the AC-OPF problem. In its most general formulation, the robust AC optimal power  flow(RAC-OPF)  problem amounts to a two-stage robust optimization problem, in which the system operator must determine a day-ahead generation schedule that minimizes the expected cost of dispatch, given an opportunity for recourse to adjust its day-ahead schedule in real-time when the uncertain system variables have been realized. In addition to being nonconvex, the RAC-OPF problem is an infinite-dimensional optimization problem due to the need to optimize over an infinite-dimensional recourse policy space.
 
The central topic of this thesis is the development of computationally tractable convex inner and outer approximations (relaxations) for the AC-OPF problem and the RAC-OPF problem. In the first part of the thesis, we focus on the AC-OPF problem, its equivalent reformulation as a rank one constrained semidefinite program, and its semidefinite programming relaxation. First, we study an a priori sufficient condition developed in the literature, which guarantees the exactness of the relaxation and then we develop an posteriori sufficient condition, which can be used to verify the inexactness of the relaxation. For AC-OPF problems that do not satisfy the sufficient condition for exactness, we investigate the extent to which it is possible to apply a structured perturbation to the problem data to obtain a problem, which satisfies said sufficient condition and which yields an optimal solution that is feasible for the original problem. An explicit bound on the performance of the feasible solution is also derived. In addition to perturbation-based inner approximations, we also propose an inner approximation scheme, which is based on an equivalent representation of the rank one constraint as the difference of two convex functions. Using this representation, we develop an algorithm, which is guaranteed to generate a sequence of feasible solutions with nonincreasing costs. Lastly, we propose  an iterative linearization-minimization algorithm to uncover rank one optimal solutions for the semidefinite relaxation when the relaxation is exact, but its optimal solution set contains both rank one and high rank optimal solutions. A simple bisection method is also proposed to address problems for which the linearization-minimization procedure fails to return a rank-one optimal solution.
In the second part of the thesis, we focus on the RAC-OPF problem. By restricting the space of recourse policies to those which are affine in the uncertain problem data, we propose a method to approximate RAC-OPF from within by a finite-dimensional semidefinite program. The solution of this optimization problem gives rise  to an affine recourse policy for the RAC-OPF problem. In addition to the inner approximation, we develop a method for constructing a second-order cone outer approximation to the RAC-OPF problem. The crux of our approach centers on the reformulation of RAC-OPF as a robust rank one constrained semidefinite program, which is then relaxed to a robust linear program. The relaxation is obtained by eliminating the rank one constraint and by approximating the cone of positive semidefinite matrices from without by a polyhedral cone. A recursive method is also developed, which refines said polyhedral cone in those regions that are important for optimization\ to improve the performance of the relaxation. The practical value of our method is that one can obtain a feasible solution to the RAC-OPF problem by solving a finite-dimensional semidefinite program whose suboptimality can be bounded by solving a second-order cone program.  In addition, if the gap between the optimal values of the outer and inner approximations is small, we have a certificate of near optimality of the feasible solution obtained. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to provide a systematic method for computing a feasible solution to the RAC-OPF problem and a nontrivial global lower bound on its optimal value via convex optimization.
As the final contribution, we develop computationally tractable inner and outer approximations to robust semidefinite programs, a class of optimization problems that is NP-hard in general. The proposed method  relies on approximating the positive semidefinite cone from within and without by appropriate polyhedral cones. In addition, we develop a recursive method, which refines these cones to sharpen the approximations. In particular our method, eliminates the optimal solution of the approximation at the current iteration step from the feasible set of the approximation at the next iteration step."

Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) possess the ability to play a critical role in these applications by interacting with microbiology electrochemically. While most efforts have been aimed at environmental, energy, and chemical production aspects, BESs have demonstrated value as tools for the study of complex microbiomes. Here, I performed work with the goal of developing a BES reactor that could be employed to study hydrogen-gas producing syntrophs to understand their role in critical environments, and further to enrich and isolate syntrophs in pure culture from their microbiome. I first studied poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) as a coating for electrodes to increased BES performance in both large-scale systems and BESs aimed for sensing applications. I then modeled and performed experiments to support the model to understand the complex synergistic interactions of microbes using redox-active mediators to interact with BES electrodes. Finally, I modeled and developed a novel BES architecture to enrich and isolate syntrophs from their microbiome so that they can be studied in pure-culture to understand their role in the environment. My results indicate that the BES architecture, which I built and tested based on modeling, was successful at enriching syntrophs, and indicated further steps that can lead to syntroph isolation.		12/31/22	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:40:43Z (GMT).

Waite, Geoffrey Carter W||Adelson, Leslie Allen||McBride, Patrizia C.	2018-10-03T18:40:44Z			12/30/17		This dissertation explores literary economies of prose in German-language literature from the 1830s to the early twentieth century, granting particular focus to questions of economic value. The problem of value, this study argues, becomes a central literary concern after the end of the Kunstperiode (Heine) when the question of literature‚Äôs relation to everyday life ‚Äì the central problem of prosaic art ‚Äì turns into a reflection on the value of literature as art, as commodity, as work. While value remains an elusive problem in aesthetic, economic, and moral discourses of the nineteenth and early-twentieth century, literary authors such as Ludwig Tieck, Gottfried Keller, and Robert Walser generate an arsenal of value forms (Marx) that, in different ways, interrogate and shape relations between literature and the world, life and art, work and play, and, most of all, the status of the economic in literary texts. I analyze three value forms in Tieck, Keller, and Walser: lack and surplus; credit and debt; performance (Leistung) and invention. The problem of prose‚Äôs value is literalized in Ludwig Tieck‚Äôs novella Des Lebens √úberflu√ü (1838), which documents how a last-resort Romantic attempt to turn the lack of poetry in a prosaic world into surplus runs up against value‚Äôs sine qua non: finitude or, in Tieck‚Äôs novella, need. I then analyze relations of credit and debt in Gottfried Keller‚Äôs 1874 novella Kleider machen Leute, which, I argue, engages central discussions about what constitutes value in late-nineteenth-century political economy, philosophy, and aesthetics as it reframes the older narrative trope of fortune in terms of a capitalist transfiguration: the risky turn from insolvency to solvency and vice versa. A last chapter argues for a subtype of literary genre, which I call the Leistungsroman, and which I trace specifically to Robert Walser‚Äôs novel Der Geh√ºlfe (1908). Walser‚Äôs novel about clerical work and the insolvency of an entrepreneurial engineer pivots not around the question of Bildung but around the clerical employee‚Äôs (often written) job performance in the context of a division of labor between invention and performance (Leistung). The move to a Leistungsroman enacts a transvaluation of the modern novel, and the values of human and literary innovation and productivity that underwrite it, by reconfiguring the novel‚Äôs relation to work, action, and invention.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:40:44Z (GMT).

I find that a nontrivial portion of public firms, even among those with intense advertising activities, do not disclose advertising expenses in their financial statements, indicating significant disclosure discretion. I further use product category-level data to construct measures that capture firm-level advertising rivalry. I predict and find that the likelihood of disclosing advertising expenses is negatively associated with advertising rivalry. This association is more pronounced when firms have less trackable media outlets, more volatile underlying advertising expenditures, and more mature products. These findings suggest that firms consider their advertising expenditures proprietary and that concerns of product market competition discourage their disclosure of advertising expenses despite the materiality constraint.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:22Z (GMT).

Many ethnic Mexican workers (persons of Mexican heritage regardless of their nationality or U.S. citizenship status) embraced leftist politics and worked with radical unionists of all races to critique and contest the powerful business interests that were determined to transform the region into a financially lucrative community primarily for the white upper and middle classes. Workers‚Äô hard-fought battles to create a more egalitarian and socially inclusive society had consequences for Greater San Diego that reverberate to this day. The relentless pursuit of profit by wealthy business interests like real estate and transportation magnate John D. Spreckels and his fellow boosters ‚Äì a group consisting of local politicians, shopkeepers, sheriffs, and others aspiring of upward mobility ‚Äì created a narrowly-defined, hyper-patriotic community that impacted the material lives of workers, especially non-whites and non-citizens whose labor and civil rights were most vulnerable. Anti-leftist measures adopted by boosters and business interests, from the restrictive free speech ordinances and ‚Äúmove on‚Äù laws to the vigilante terror and deportations, transformed Greater San Diego into a staunchly anti-labor region as early as 1911.  In labeling the ideologies espoused and practiced by groups such as the Partido Liberal Mexicano (PLM), the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), and the United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing, and Allied Workers of America (UCAPAWA) as subversive and ‚Äúun-American,‚Äù boosters and business interests eroded support for the worker cause and helped stunt multiracial and multi-ethnic working-class solidarity in the borderlands.  Although initially sympathetic, white workers affiliated with the more conservative American Federation of Labor came to vehemently denounce leftist politics in order to safeguard the higher pay and other rights and privileges afforded to them by their race. That laborers continued to reject working class segmentation and to endure ostracism is significant.  Leftist workers and organizations, particularly those informed by a radical tradition and living memory of past workers‚Äô movements, believed the means to the working classes‚Äô freedom and full inclusion into American society was not through sectarianism, but rather through unity.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:21Z (GMT).

While recent scholarship has reevaluated social development in the Minoan and Mycenaean archaic states, several contradictions characterize the current state of Early Cycladic (EC) scholarship. In this dissertation, I use small worlds analysis‚Äîa bottom-up approach that examines habitual interaction between the communities that comprise small world networks (Tartaron 2008; 2013)‚Äîto reconsider the nature of EC intercommunity interaction. By combining a small worlds approach with GIS settlement and landscape analyses, I address the following questions: what impact did subsistence strategies have on social organization, to what degree were EC communities reliant on one another, and what was the role of maritime travel in maintaining small world connections?
Analysis of archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological evidence shows that EC islanders employed a variety of subsistence strategies to minimize risk, diversifying production spatially and temporally rather than relying on the production of surplus (contra Renfrew 1972). Site catchment analysis reveals that available agricultural land could support a much larger population than is typically estimated for this time period, emphasizing the viability of spatial diversification.
EC communities likely cooperated in agricultural production to ensure mutual survival (cf. Halstead 1981, 1986). While analysis of EC fortifications shows that warfare might have been a regular feature of island life, social nearness and community interdependence for subsistence meant that conflict was probably short-lived and minimally damaging. The fragmented Cycladic landscape meant that communities located in peripheral locations‚Äîsuch as one small world in southeastern Naxos‚Äîenjoyed long-lived and stable connections.
Finally, GIS analysis of small world maritime travel, combined with analysis of the agricultural production cycle, reveals that there was no ""sailing season"" for undertaking long-range maritime travel during the EC period. Rather, short-range journeys might have been undertaken opportunistically throughout the year. Long-range voyages were necessary for larger, more isolated communities that could not maintain habitual maritime connections with other communities, and voyages at the regional scale likely occurred only infrequently."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:34Z (GMT).

SIRT6 is one of the seven mammalian sirtuins and has diverse biological functions such as maintaining genomic stability, controlling glucose homeostasis and suppressing tumor growth. Enzymatically, SIRT6 has been shown to have lysine deacetylation, lysine defatty-acylation and mono-adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyltransferase activities. However, the contribution of each activity to the various functions of SIRT6 is poorly understood.
In Chapter 2, I describe the dissection of functional contribution of the defatty-acylase activity of SIRT6 by utilizing a SIRT6 mutant (Gly60Ala), which has efficient defatty-acylase activity but no detectable deacetylase and mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase activities. Using this mutant, I found that SIRT6‚Äôs defatty-acylase activity regulates the secretion of numerous proteins in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Interestingly, SIRT6 defatty-acylase activity regulates the sorting of many ribosomal proteins into exosomes for secretion.
In Chapter 3, I found that SIRT6 defatty-acylase activity contributes to its tumor suppressor function. To identify SIRT6 defatty-acylation targets, I utilized a fatty acid reporter to metabolically label the proteome followed by affinity enrichment and mass spectrometry analysis. I found that R-Ras2 is a SIRT6 defatty-acylation target that accounts for its tumor suppressor function. Mechanistically, lysine fatty-acylation of R-Ras2 promotes its plasma membrane localization and increases its interaction with PI3K. The increase in R-Ras2 and PI3K association leads to elevated Akt activation and increased cell proliferation.
In Chapter 4, I describe an interactome study of KRas4a and KRas4b, which led to the identification of many previously unknown KRas4a and KRas4b interacting proteins. Interestingly, I found that KRas4a interacts more with Raf1 than KRas4b does, which may contribute to the more anchorage-independent colony formation in KRas4a transformed NIH 3T3 cells than in KRas4b transformed NIH 3T3 cells. Moreover, mTOR was identified as a KRas4a/b interaction protein. Different from well-established mTORC1 and mTORC2, KRas4a/b forms a new mTOR complex without raptor or rictor in cells."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:40:44Z (GMT).

Providing affordable and reliable service entails the determination of an operating point for the power system, which minimizes the total cost of generation while respecting the physical and operational constraints of the system. At the core of reliability and affordability challenges is the AC optimal power flow problem (AC-OPF). In its most general form, the AC-OPF problem is a high-dimensional  optimization problem that is nonconvex and NP hard in general. In addition to reliability and affordability challenges, in recent years there has been a growing need to develop optimization methods, which enable the reliable and efficient operation of power systems that have a large fraction of their power supplied from intermittent renewable energy resources, like wind and solar. The need to accommodate the intrinsic uncertainty in the power supply of such resources will require the development of robust optimization methods for the AC-OPF problem. In its most general formulation, the robust AC optimal power  flow(RAC-OPF)  problem amounts to a two-stage robust optimization problem, in which the system operator must determine a day-ahead generation schedule that minimizes the expected cost of dispatch, given an opportunity for recourse to adjust its day-ahead schedule in real-time when the uncertain system variables have been realized. In addition to being nonconvex, the RAC-OPF problem is an infinite-dimensional optimization problem due to the need to optimize over an infinite-dimensional recourse policy space.
 
The central topic of this thesis is the development of computationally tractable convex inner and outer approximations (relaxations) for the AC-OPF problem and the RAC-OPF problem. In the first part of the thesis, we focus on the AC-OPF problem, its equivalent reformulation as a rank one constrained semidefinite program, and its semidefinite programming relaxation. First, we study an a priori sufficient condition developed in the literature, which guarantees the exactness of the relaxation and then we develop an posteriori sufficient condition, which can be used to verify the inexactness of the relaxation. For AC-OPF problems that do not satisfy the sufficient condition for exactness, we investigate the extent to which it is possible to apply a structured perturbation to the problem data to obtain a problem, which satisfies said sufficient condition and which yields an optimal solution that is feasible for the original problem. An explicit bound on the performance of the feasible solution is also derived. In addition to perturbation-based inner approximations, we also propose an inner approximation scheme, which is based on an equivalent representation of the rank one constraint as the difference of two convex functions. Using this representation, we develop an algorithm, which is guaranteed to generate a sequence of feasible solutions with nonincreasing costs. Lastly, we propose  an iterative linearization-minimization algorithm to uncover rank one optimal solutions for the semidefinite relaxation when the relaxation is exact, but its optimal solution set contains both rank one and high rank optimal solutions. A simple bisection method is also proposed to address problems for which the linearization-minimization procedure fails to return a rank-one optimal solution.
In the second part of the thesis, we focus on the RAC-OPF problem. By restricting the space of recourse policies to those which are affine in the uncertain problem data, we propose a method to approximate RAC-OPF from within by a finite-dimensional semidefinite program. The solution of this optimization problem gives rise  to an affine recourse policy for the RAC-OPF problem. In addition to the inner approximation, we develop a method for constructing a second-order cone outer approximation to the RAC-OPF problem. The crux of our approach centers on the reformulation of RAC-OPF as a robust rank one constrained semidefinite program, which is then relaxed to a robust linear program. The relaxation is obtained by eliminating the rank one constraint and by approximating the cone of positive semidefinite matrices from without by a polyhedral cone. A recursive method is also developed, which refines said polyhedral cone in those regions that are important for optimization\ to improve the performance of the relaxation. The practical value of our method is that one can obtain a feasible solution to the RAC-OPF problem by solving a finite-dimensional semidefinite program whose suboptimality can be bounded by solving a second-order cone program.  In addition, if the gap between the optimal values of the outer and inner approximations is small, we have a certificate of near optimality of the feasible solution obtained. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to provide a systematic method for computing a feasible solution to the RAC-OPF problem and a nontrivial global lower bound on its optimal value via convex optimization.
As the final contribution, we develop computationally tractable inner and outer approximations to robust semidefinite programs, a class of optimization problems that is NP-hard in general. The proposed method  relies on approximating the positive semidefinite cone from within and without by appropriate polyhedral cones. In addition, we develop a recursive method, which refines these cones to sharpen the approximations. In particular our method, eliminates the optimal solution of the approximation at the current iteration step from the feasible set of the approximation at the next iteration step."

Developing an understanding of how to control semiconductor surfaces using solution-based methods is critical, both as a method to rationally control surface structure, and as a means to study surface reactions at the molecular scale in the ambient conditions relevant to applications. This dissertation shows that both silicon and metal oxide semiconductors can be controlled and studied at the atomic scale using solution-based methods. In this work, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) was used to investigate the structure of semiconductor surfaces, surface spectroscopy was used to study the chemical composition and orientation of adsorbed molecules, and computer simulations and calculations were used to verify and provide insight into experimental results.
Using these methods, the solution-deposition of a nearly perfect organic monolayer of benzoate on atomically flat rutile (110) TiO2 was studied. The phenyl rings of benzoate molecules on rutile (110) were found to adopt an unexpected tetrameric structure as a result of œÄ-œÄ interactions, resolving a controversy surrounding the bonding geometry of benzoate molecules on this surface. 
In addition, the photoreactivity of TiO2 was studied using solution-deposited monolayers of benzoate and phenylphosphinate on anatase (001) and rutile (110). The photodecomposition kinetics of these monolayers in air was monitored with in-situ infrared spectroscopy, and the structures of the reacted surfaces were investigated with ex-situ STM. In all cases studied, the photoreaction kinetics followed unusual biexponential kinetics, in which the photodecomposition rate decreases by approximately two orders of magnitude after a fraction (typically ~25%) of the molecules have reacted. This trend in reactivity is proposed to result from changes in the magnitude of band bending at the surface.
Lastly, two solution-based methods for the functionalization of Si (111) surfaces were investigated with STM, surface spectroscopy, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. It was found that a methoxylation process unexpectedly etches the silicon surface, and a new direct method for the fluorination of Si (111) using HF(aq) was discovered."

Participants also rated their memory detailedness, memory valence, and emotional intensity for each of their memories, as well as their self-construal. This empirical study found that across cultures, people tend to recall more specific memories than general memories. Moreover, this study found an interaction effect between memory type and culture on memory accessibility, with Asians recalling more general events, whereas European Americans recalling more specific events. Our findings suggested that specific memories, compared with general memories, tended to be stronger in emotional intensity. Lastly, we found that independent self-construal would be helpful for individuals to report positive and intense emotion in their specific memory.

While recent scholarship has reevaluated social development in the Minoan and Mycenaean archaic states, several contradictions characterize the current state of Early Cycladic (EC) scholarship. In this dissertation, I use small worlds analysis‚Äîa bottom-up approach that examines habitual interaction between the communities that comprise small world networks (Tartaron 2008; 2013)‚Äîto reconsider the nature of EC intercommunity interaction. By combining a small worlds approach with GIS settlement and landscape analyses, I address the following questions: what impact did subsistence strategies have on social organization, to what degree were EC communities reliant on one another, and what was the role of maritime travel in maintaining small world connections?
Analysis of archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological evidence shows that EC islanders employed a variety of subsistence strategies to minimize risk, diversifying production spatially and temporally rather than relying on the production of surplus (contra Renfrew 1972).

Inventory levels are replenished at the end of each period instantaneously. We apply robust optimization under an uncertainty set that captures a risk pooling phenomenon across items to this problem. The number of constraints governing the uncertainty set grows linearly in the number of items. A closed form solution is presented for the single and two-item cases. For the general n item problem, we present a 2-approximation algorithm and demonstrate its asymptotic optimality. The experimental results confirm the value of the approximation algorithm and indicate that the average performance is close to optimal.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:23Z (GMT).

Solitary, ground-nesting bees comprise the vast majority of bees in the world; however, these important pollinators are relatively understudied and we know little about how they are impacted by resource availability, pollen quality, and microbial associates. My dissertation research uses plants of the genus Cucurbita as a case study to assess differential health concerns associated with generalist (Bombus impatiens and Apis mellifera) and specialist (Peponapis pruinosa) pollinators on a shared resource. I begin by examining how cucurbit plant chemistry varies across plant tissue types and varieties and how this variation impacts the foraging choices of both generalist and specialist bees in an agricultural system. Next, I assess the physiological costs associated with digesting cucurbit pollen for these generalist and specialist bees. Finally, I explore the microbial community associated with a specialist ground-nesting bee‚Äôs brood cells, evaluate how this community changes over space and time, and assess the most likely routes of microbial colonization into brood cells.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:24Z (GMT).

This change in mineralization rate is referred to as priming, and may have important implications for  carbon (C) turnover in soil.  This study identifies several positive and negative priming mechanisms using high-resolution Carbon Dioxide (CO2)  measurements of a series of short-term incubation experiments with 13C-labeled PyOM added to a temperate forest topsoil. Irrespective of pyrolysis temperature (200-750¬∞C), addition of more than 2 mg PyOM g-1 soil significantly decreased mineralization of nSOC. Over 35 days, dilution was found to be a relevant process accounting for 20% of negative priming observed  at day 7, and 13% at day 35. In comparison, substrate switching  accounted for  only 1.2% of negative priming at day 7 and 1.1% at day 35.  Inhibition did not explain reductions in nSOC mineralization since the microbial biomass did not decrease in comparison to an unamended control. Sorption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from soil was responsible for the majority of negative priming observed with PyOM additions based on adsorption isotherm experiments as well as co-location of nSOC on PyOM surfaces shown by NanoSIMS. Maximum sorption potential of soil DOC was 29 times higher for PyOM pyrolyzed at 450¬∞C than for the topsoil, and again tripled with an increase in pyrolysis temperature to 750¬∞C. The contribution of the mechanisms mentioned above changed with time: dilution decreased after 7 days and substrate switching which initially made up less than 1% of negative priming in higher temperature PyOM could not be detected making sorption the dominant negative priming mechanism on monthly time scales. These results have long-term SOC storage implications, as sorption has longer lasting effects than substrate switching or dilution. Understanding the time-scale of sorption and potential desorption will require further long-term studies.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:24Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Chapter 1 treats the dialectic of Confessions XII and argues that Augustine privileges the intention of the human author of Scripture as the best possible meaning of the text that readers must try to find, though they can still find other valid interpretations as long as they are seeking the author‚Äôs intention. Chapters 2-4 then treat six principles that Augustine appeals to in his theory of Scriptural interpretation. Chapter 2 argues for an inherent connection between Augustine‚Äôs intentionalism and his starting claim that Scripture is true inasmuch as it is authored by God; it also discusses his first interpretive principle, by which he appeals to general and linguistic knowledge as a prerequisite for interpretation. Chapter 3 explains three principles that Augustine ties together in a series and bases on the content of Scripture: Christ‚Äôs command to love God and neighbor as the purpose of all Scripture; the role of ‚Äúclearly stated‚Äù (aperte posita) passages in establishing the parameters for the moral and doctrinal content of Scripture; and the use of figurative interpretation in understanding all Scripture, but especially passages that are unclear or objectionable. Chapter 4 argues that Augustine also uses two sources outside of Scripture, the authoritative statements of the Church and the sure arguments of philosophy or science, to limit and to add to the possible meanings of Scriptural passages. Chapter 5 returns to the issue of the human writer's intention and its role in interpretation, comparing the account in De Doctrina Christiana and Confessions XII to the earlier one in De Utilitate Credendi, and then proposing a larger theory of the role of the writer‚Äôs intention in light of some of Augustine‚Äôs later works.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:22Z (GMT).

function. To generate polarity during growth, budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae transports all necessary organelles into the bud. This transport requires the essential myosin V motor, Myo2. Using different cargo receptors, Myo2 transports secretory vesicles, mitochondria, vacuoles and other cargoes. A conditional mutant myo2-66 in particular fails to transport secretory vesicles. Initially discovered as a multicopy suppressor of myo2-66, Smy1 suggested the involvement of a kinesin motor for transport of secretory vesicles. However, because suppression does not need either kinesin motor activity or an interaction with microtubules, the function of Smy1 remained elusive.
Here I show that kinesin-related Smy1 stabilizes the association between Myo2 and the
secretory vesicle receptor, the Rab GTPase Sec4. Smy1 function is specific for secretory vesicle transport. Characterization of Smy1 individual domains indicates that full length Smy1 is required since the head domain is important for vesicle association and the tail domain for
Myo2 binding. Furthermore, I used a GAL1 cDNA library to suppress a conditional myo2 smy1 mutant as a way to identify additional components that may function in secretory vesicle transport. One novel component we identified has a RhoGAP domain in its C-terminus, so I named it GYM1 (GAP with Yeast Myo2). I found that Gym1 is polarized to the bud and its localization is dependent on Myo2. Further, biochemical assays showed that Gym1specifically stimulates the GTPase activity of Rho3 and mutation of its critical arginine at residue 546 abolishes this activity. Genetic analysis also showed that the ability of Gym1 to suppress the myo2 smy1 mutant requires the GAP activity towards Rho3. In mammalian cells, TC10 Rho proteins are also reported to mediate vesicle transport. This new finding of Rho3 and its associated GAP, Gym1 in budding yeast suggests that there is an interplay between Rho and Rab GTPases in secretory vesicle transport."

By detecting magnetic resonance mechanically, as a force or force-gradient, on an ultrasensitive microcantilever, magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) couples the sensitivity of scanning probe microscopy with the isotopic specificity of magnetic resonance. While MRFM offers the depth of view and sensitivity required for magnetic resonance imaging with nanometer resolution, imaging experiments to date have been largely limited by long signal acquisition times and low signal-to-noise imparted by imaging small spin ensembles. In the limit of detecting nuclear magnetic moments or electron spin labels from a single biomolecule, the magnetic resonance signal is largely dominated by statistical polarization fluctuations --- so-called `spin noise' --- rather than the well-defined Curie-law magnetization detected in macroscale magnetic resonance experiments. In this dissertation, we discuss the development of a microscope with the sensitivity required to perform three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance imaging with nanometer resolution and imaging of nitroxide spin radicals at the single spin level. We propose and demonstrate protocols to overcome the spin-noise limit by generating hyperthermal proton spin magnetization via microwave-assisted dynamic nuclear polarization for the first time in a MRFM experiment. The modest 10 to 20 times enhancement in nuclear spin magnetization reported in this work is sufficient to push a spin ensemble containing ~$10^5$ proton spins, the approximate size of a protein, out of the spin-noise limit and into the regime where thermal polarization is dominant. Furthermore, we discuss microscope developments and sample preparation protocols to reduce the cantilever frequency noise experienced by a nanomagnet tipped cantilever operating near a sample surface by nearly two orders of magnitude. With these methods implemented, we propose a spin modulation protocol capable of detecting and imaging individual electron spin probes affixed to a biological sample. Promising preliminary results show the sensitivity required for imaging a single electron spin with an attonewton sensitivity cantilever. The magnetic resonance force microscope experiments described here offer new paths to achieving high-resolution, single molecule magnetic resonance imaging --- an extremely exciting prospect.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:26Z (GMT).

Developing an understanding of how to control semiconductor surfaces using solution-based methods is critical, both as a method to rationally control surface structure, and as a means to study surface reactions at the molecular scale in the ambient conditions relevant to applications. This dissertation shows that both silicon and metal oxide semiconductors can be controlled and studied at the atomic scale using solution-based methods. In this work, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) was used to investigate the structure of semiconductor surfaces, surface spectroscopy was used to study the chemical composition and orientation of adsorbed molecules, and computer simulations and calculations were used to verify and provide insight into experimental results.
Using these methods, the solution-deposition of a nearly perfect organic monolayer of benzoate on atomically flat rutile (110) TiO2 was studied. The phenyl rings of benzoate molecules on rutile (110) were found to adopt an unexpected tetrameric structure as a result of œÄ-œÄ interactions, resolving a controversy surrounding the bonding geometry of benzoate molecules on this surface. 
In addition, the photoreactivity of TiO2 was studied using solution-deposited monolayers of benzoate and phenylphosphinate on anatase (001) and rutile (110). The photodecomposition kinetics of these monolayers in air was monitored with in-situ infrared spectroscopy, and the structures of the reacted surfaces were investigated with ex-situ STM. In all cases studied, the photoreaction kinetics followed unusual biexponential kinetics, in which the photodecomposition rate decreases by approximately two orders of magnitude after a fraction (typically ~25%) of the molecules have reacted. This trend in reactivity is proposed to result from changes in the magnitude of band bending at the surface.
Lastly, two solution-based methods for the functionalization of Si (111) surfaces were investigated with STM, surface spectroscopy, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. It was found that a methoxylation process unexpectedly etches the silicon surface, and a new direct method for the fluorination of Si (111) using HF(aq) was discovered."

Estroff, Lara A.	2018-10-02T20:14:36Z			12/30/17		Polymorphism, the phenomenon in which a compound crystallizes into more than one solid state crystal structure, has drawn attention in many industry fields, especially pharmaceuticals. In recent years, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have been used to study polymorph control because of their well-defined surface chemistry and structure. Furthermore, by tuning the substrate-crystal interface energy, potentially SAMs can promote the nucleation of polymorphs not accessible via solution methods. These advantages have led us to choose heterogeneous surface nucleation via SAMs as the primary means to study polymorph selection. In this work, we have examined multiple SAM chemistries on gold and silicon in the presence of various solvent systems to investigate their ability to influence the nucleation, crystal growth, and polymorph selection of a common drug, acetaminophen (ACM). We have found that both solvent and substrate work together to control crystal polymorph.  On hydrophobic, methyl and phenyl terminated surfaces, using water, ethanol, or dioxane as solvent results in the monoclinic polymorph, while the orthorhombic polymorph is formed when using mixtures of water and dioxane. As a comparison to hydrophobic surfaces, hydroxyl terminated surfaces were investigated. In this case, using ethanol or dioxane as solvents results in orthorhombic polymorph selection, clearly different from crystallization results on hydrophobic surfaces. Interestingly, the methyl and phenyl terminated surfaces that promote the formation of the less thermodynamically stable orthorhombic form of ACM show (002) cleavage planes perpendicular to the substrate, while the -OH terminated surfaces induce that same polymorph with the (002) cleavage planes parallel to the substrate surface. We hypothesize that this selection is due to the energetic favorability of certain crystal facets interacting with the chemically distinct SAM surfaces.		12/31/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:36Z (GMT).

We performed an ENU forward mutagenesis screen in mice aimed at identifying genes which regulate early organ morphogenesis during development. Fifteen mouse mutants were identified in the screen which possess cardiovascular, craniofacial, extraembryonic, or general body morphology defects. After performing preliminary characterization of all 15 lines, we identified a likely causative mutation in 14 of the 15 mutants. 1D and 13B mutants both exhibit craniofacial defects and were selected for in-depth characterization to identify the molecular mechanisms whereby they regulate embryogenesis. 1D mutants are characterized by an open neural tube in the hindbrain region. This phenotype is similar to human embryos with exencephaly, a congenital birth malformation of high incidence in the human population. Positional cloning of 1D identified a mutation in SPCA1, a Golgi-localized pump that controls calcium homeostasis. Results from the molecular characterization of mouse 1D mutants, as well as from time lapse microscopy of chicken embryos, revealed that calcium is tightly regulated during neural tube closure and that calcium homeostasis is required to promote apical constriction of neuroepithelial cells. These results show that SPCA1 activity is required to regulate the actomyosin dynamics that propel apical constriction, and that the actin severing protein, Cofilin 1, is a key mediator of SPCA1 function. Together, my findings provide the first genetic evidence that calcium homeostasis is needed for neural tube closure, opening a new window into understanding the etiology of human neural tube defects. 13B mutants have neural tube defects accompanied by a suite of other malformations including randomized L-R patterning and maxillary overgrowth. Molecular characterization revealed that all 13B phenotypes result from the absence of cilia, an organelle important for neural tube patterning and for the establishment of L-R asymmetry. Exome sequencing of 13B embryos identified a nonsense mutation in Pibf1. I show that PIBF1 is required for ciliogenesis during early embryonic development and identify a novel role for PIBF1 in regulating centrosome duplication. These findings highlight the importance of PIBF1 in regulating multiple aspects of centrosome biology, and provide a model for understanding how defects in these processes contribute to human ciliopathies.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:29Z (GMT).

In recent years, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have been used to study polymorph control because of their well-defined surface chemistry and structure. Furthermore, by tuning the substrate-crystal interface energy, potentially SAMs can promote the nucleation of polymorphs not accessible via solution methods. These advantages have led us to choose heterogeneous surface nucleation via SAMs as the primary means to study polymorph selection. In this work, we have examined multiple SAM chemistries on gold and silicon in the presence of various solvent systems to investigate their ability to influence the nucleation, crystal growth, and polymorph selection of a common drug, acetaminophen (ACM). We have found that both solvent and substrate work together to control crystal polymorph.  On hydrophobic, methyl and phenyl terminated surfaces, using water, ethanol, or dioxane as solvent results in the monoclinic polymorph, while the orthorhombic polymorph is formed when using mixtures of water and dioxane. As a comparison to hydrophobic surfaces, hydroxyl terminated surfaces were investigated. In this case, using ethanol or dioxane as solvents results in orthorhombic polymorph selection, clearly different from crystallization results on hydrophobic surfaces. Interestingly, the methyl and phenyl terminated surfaces that promote the formation of the less thermodynamically stable orthorhombic form of ACM show (002) cleavage planes perpendicular to the substrate, while the -OH terminated surfaces induce that same polymorph with the (002) cleavage planes parallel to the substrate surface. We hypothesize that this selection is due to the energetic favorability of certain crystal facets interacting with the chemically distinct SAM surfaces.		12/31/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:40:48Z (GMT).

Although not a major cause of mortality, these conditions pose significant problems for those affected, including necessary surgical interventions, psychological difficulty and a higher mortality risk. Epidemiological studies of populations affected by clefting, combined with genetic analyses, have identified candidate genes, genomic regions of interest as well as environmental risk factors. Analyses of these factors in mouse models has provided insight into craniofacial morphogenesis. Concurrently, novel factors, discovered through mouse mutagenesis, have been identified in affected human populations. Using modern imaging techniques, overt clefting has been revealed to be part of larger phenotypic spectrum. For this reason, detailed morphological studies of mouse-mutants with craniofacial phenotypes are necessary for effective modeling and comparisons to be made. The Pbx genes (Pbx 1-2-3), TALE homeodomain-containing transcription factors, are believed to play integral roles in the development of many organ systems including the midfacial complex. By immunofluorescence antibody assay, this study provides the first detailed analyses of how Pbx1 & Pbx2 are expressed temporally and spatially in the developing murine midface, over the developmental time-period critical for development of the lip, primary and secondary palates (E10.5 to E13.5). Pbx1&2 expression was observed in epithelium and mesenchyme from the very earliest stages of facial morphogenesis, and into the later stages of palatal development. Excision of Pbx1 from the cephalic epithelium or pre-migratory Cranial Neural Crest cells revealed highly distinct and temporally divergent phenotypes. For the cephalic epithelial mutant (Pbx1fl/fl ; Pbx2wt, FoxG1Crewt/+), cleft lip, extending into the primary palate with clefting of the secondary palate was the primary observation, whereas Pbx1 excision from premigratory Cranial Neural Crest Cells on a Pbx2 deficient background (Pbx1fl/fl ; Pbx2¬¨+/-, Wnt1Cretg/+), yielded cleft palate only with a ‚Äúbridging phenotype‚Äù rostrally and palatal shelf hypoplasia. Micro-CT analysis enabled identification of craniofacial elements responsible for the distinct facial/palatal phenotypes. Specifically, the Epithelial Mutant exhibited: 1) an increase in the distance from the incisor alveolus to the caudal basisphenoid; 2) rostro-caudal shortening and widening of the premaxilla; 3) diagonal lengthening of the maxilla; 4) reduction of the maxillary width; and 5) widening of the distance between the zygomatic spurs of the maxillae. The Cranial Neural Crest Cell mutant displayed: 1) rostro-caudal shortening of the cranial base as measured from the basioccipital bone to the incisor alveolus; 2) increase of premaxillary width at both rostral tip and caudal end; 3) shortening and widening of the maxillae; and 4) an increase in the inter-maxillary distance. Although divergent, the morphological outcome in both mutants was a broadening and shortening of the midface. Because the morphological perturbations in the Cranial Neural Crest Cell Mutant suggested a re-arrangement of the relationship between the rostral and caudal fields of the secondary palate, the regional expression patterns of known markers of these regions was examined by in situ hybridization. These studies demonstrated lateralization of the anterior field of the secondary palate and a sagittal, rostral displacement of the posterior palatal field. This study provides the field with detailed expression patterns for Pbx proteins in the developing midface as well as analysis of the facial phenotypes that result from epithelial and ecto-mesenchymal loss of Pbx genes. As such it will be a valuable resource for craniofacial research.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:35Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Vitamin A deficiency and age-related macular degeneration are highly prevalent and result from insufficient dietary intake of certain carotenoids. Improvement of the levels and balance of these nutrients in maize grain through breeding, i.e. biofortification, has been proposed as a cost-effective solution to ameliorate deficiency. To do so requires a more comprehensive dissection of the loci governing natural variation of carotenoid and tocochromanol traits, with high statistical power and mapping resolution, in grain of maize and other major cereal crops. Our group conducted joint linkage-genome wide association studies (JL-GWAS) and RNA-seq expression analyses for these traits in the 5000-line US maize nested association mapping (NAM) population. The majority of identified QTL were found to be underpinned by genes with a priori roles in carotenoid and/or tocochromanol synthesis and retention, including prenyl group synthesis. Surprisingly, two homologs encoding a chlorophyll biosynthetic enzyme explained the majority of variation for saturated tocochromanols (i.e., tocopherols). While maize grain is non-photosynthetic, small levels of chlorophyll were found to be present in embryo, suggestive along with other evidence of a chlorophyll biosynthetic cycle providing phytol for tocopherol synthesis. Overall, more than half of the identified QTL were eQTL, and most also had highly correlated QTL allelic effect estimates across traits, suggesting that pleiotropy within these biosynthetic pathways is largely regulated at the expression level. A number of significant pairwise epistatic interactions were additionally detected, particularly for carotenoids, between identified genes within and outside of the biosynthetic pathway. Finally, our group is analyzing carotenoid and tocochromanol nutritional profiles and agronomic performance of 350 tropically adapted maize hybrids evaluated under combined drought and heat stress in conjunction with the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), Harare, Zimbabwe. In addition to analyzing genetics and genomics within a key target environment for orange, provitamin A-dense (i.e. biofortified) orange maize, candidate lines are being identified and incorporated into the HarvestPlus breeding program to produce nutritious, climate-resilient varieties for the rainfed production areas of southern Africa.		12/18/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:36Z (GMT).

The majority of commercially available YAN supplementation products consist of inorganic nitrogen in the form of Diammonium Phosphate (DAP).  Recent work has shown that the addition of organic nitrogen sources, such as autolyzed yeast nutrient or mixed amino acids, can confer additional benefits in terms of fermentation kinetics and volatile profiles.   Further, fermentation temperature and nitrogen metabolism appear to have an interactive effect, meaning that nutrient packages may have varying outcomes at different fermentation temperatures.  This work sought to add to the understanding of the impacts of nitrogen source and supplementation level by comparing the chemistry and sensory properties of wines supplemented with a range of inorganic versus organic nitrogen sources and at two different supplementation rates. Wine sensory attributes were assessed by a panel using a projective mapping technique known as Napping¬Æ.  Wines that received the lower supplementation rate across several treatments were associated with more desirable sensory attributes.   
A subsequent experiment examined the impact of fermentation temperature on the chemical and sensory outcomes of Riesling using inorganic or organic nitrogen sources at three different fermentation temperatures.  Fermentation temperature had a strong effect on fermentation kinetics, with warmer fermentation temperatures yielding faster fermentation.  These wines were also evaluated by Napping¬Æ, and wines fermented at the lowest temperature were associated with more desirable sensory attributes."

The emergence of next generation sequencing technology has allowed us to do more comprehensive studies of these mutations in the mitochondrial genome, especially for low frequency heteroplasmic mutations. In my research projects, I combined experimental and computational approaches to investigate mtDNA heteroplasmies in different medical disciplines. I first conducted a literature review to summarize recent findings on the implications of mtDNA mutations in human diseases, with a focus on complex diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and aging. My first project was to investigate mtDNA heteroplasmy and copy number variations in a general healthy population. This population-based study indicated that both mtDNA quality and quantity decreased with age. I further found that mtDNA copy number was associated with serum bicarbonate level and white blood cell counts, while aggregate heteroplasmy load was associated with blood apolipoprotein B level. These results suggested that maintaining optimal mtDNA copy number and preventing the expansion of heteroplasmy could promote healthy aging. In my second project, I first identified heteroplasmies in 466 pairs of DNA and RNA sequencing data. I verified that most of the heteroplasmies were transcribed to RNA regardless of their pathogenic potentials. I then experimentally tested whether the heteroplasmy frequencies could change over time. My test showed that a heteroplasmy with ~50% frequency could decrease to ~1% in only 28 days. Moreover, these observed heteroplasmy dynamics could significantly affect certain gene expression levels. My third project focused on mtDNA fragments circulating in blood stream in a cell-free format. I developed an experiment protocol tailored for sequencing short DNA fragments from plasma samples. After analyzing the sequencing data, I found that the fragment length of mtDNA in plasma is much shorter than that of nuclear DNA. We also demonstrated that mtDNA heteroplasmy was detectable in the plasma sample, suggesting its potential to serve as a biomarker in different clinical applications.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:35Z (GMT).

While adults generate robust immunity to most intracellular pathogens, neonates have an impaired ability to generate long-lasting immunity. As CD8+ T cells are essential for clearing intracellular pathogens, it is crucial to understand why these cells behave differently during infection in early life. 
We previously showed that neonatal CD8+ T cells rapidly become terminally differentiated and fail to form long-term memory following infection. However, the underlying basis for these age-related differences is unclear. In this thesis, experiments were designed to investigate how neonatal and adult CD8+ T cells behave differently and what underlying mechanisms contribute to these differences. We demonstrated that different aged CD8+ T cell progenitors have different gene expression profiles. Different aged progenitors also give rise to CD8+ T cells with distinct characteristics in the periphery when developed in the same thymic environment. Ectopic expression of the developmentally regulated protein Lin28b in adult CD8+ T cells granted them neonate-like traits. Our data indicate that different aged CD8+ T cells behave differently because they have different origins and Lin28b may regulate CD8+ T cell behaviors in early life. Neonatal CD8+ T cells also acquire a much more active metabolic profile compared to adult CD8+ T cells, which may contribute to their rapid contraction and poor memory formation following infection. 
Extrinsic differences between different aged animals were also studied by transferring adult CD8+ T cells into neonatal mice. Neonatal environment was able to modify adult CD8+ T cells to become phenotypically and functionally different.

While adults generate robust immunity to most intracellular pathogens, neonates have an impaired ability to generate long-lasting immunity. As CD8+ T cells are essential for clearing intracellular pathogens, it is crucial to understand why these cells behave differently during infection in early life. 
We previously showed that neonatal CD8+ T cells rapidly become terminally differentiated and fail to form long-term memory following infection. However, the underlying basis for these age-related differences is unclear. In this thesis, experiments were designed to investigate how neonatal and adult CD8+ T cells behave differently and what underlying mechanisms contribute to these differences. We demonstrated that different aged CD8+ T cell progenitors have different gene expression profiles. Different aged progenitors also give rise to CD8+ T cells with distinct characteristics in the periphery when developed in the same thymic environment. Ectopic expression of the developmentally regulated protein Lin28b in adult CD8+ T cells granted them neonate-like traits. Our data indicate that different aged CD8+ T cells behave differently because they have different origins and Lin28b may regulate CD8+ T cell behaviors in early life. Neonatal CD8+ T cells also acquire a much more active metabolic profile compared to adult CD8+ T cells, which may contribute to their rapid contraction and poor memory formation following infection. 
Extrinsic differences between different aged animals were also studied by transferring adult CD8+ T cells into neonatal mice. Neonatal environment was able to modify adult CD8+ T cells to become phenotypically and functionally different. Neonatal-experienced adult CD8+ T cells proliferated more rapidly and formed insufficient memory. These findings suggest that in addition to cell-intrinsic factors, extrinsic factors may also contribute to age-related differences in CD8+ T cell behaviors. 
In summary, these findings advance our knowledge of neonatal CD8+ T cell responses and cast light on potential therapeutic targets early in life, such as Lin28b, mTOR and components of metabolic pathways. A more thorough understanding of neonatal immune responses is pivotal for combating diseases in neonates and improving their wellbeing."		12/18/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:40:50Z (GMT).

Thus, there is significant interest in understanding the regulation of GAC activity, with the suggestion being that higher order oligomerization is required for its activation. We used x-ray crystallography, together with site directed mutagenesis, to determine the minimal enzymatic unit capable of robust catalytic activity. Mutagenesis of the helical interface between the two pairs of dimers comprising a GAC tetramer yielded a non-active, GAC dimer whose x-ray structure displays a stationary loop (‚Äòactivation loop‚Äô) essential for coupling the binding of allosteric activators like inorganic phosphate to catalytic activity. Further mutagenesis that removed constraints on the activation loop yielded a constitutively active dimer, providing clues regarding how the activation loop communicates with the active site, as well as with a peptide segment that serves as a ‚Äòlid‚Äô to close off the active site following substrate binding. Our studies show that the formation of large GAC oligomers is not a pre-requisite for full enzymatic activity. They also offer a mechanism by which the binding of activators like inorganic phosphate enables the activation loop to communicate with the active site to ensure maximal rates of catalysis, and promotes the opening of the lid to achieve optimal product release. Moreover, these findings provide new insights into how other regulatory events might induce GAC activation within cancer cells.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:36Z (GMT).

MRI can be used for quantification of volumetric distributions of various biomolecules and chemical elements - such as triglycerides, calcium and iron - that regarded as participants in normal tissue biochemistry, and whose dysregulations are often manifested in pathologic processes. This dissertation reports optimization steps undertaken to overcome technical challenges in quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) in different parts of human body.
Often in QSM it is assumed that susceptibility is the only contributor to the observed field inhomogeneity, which may be a valid assumption for neuroimaging applications. However, multiple molecules found in biological tissues (e.g., triglycerides of fat) have a resonance frequency different from that of water, and this resonance frequency offset is referred to as chemical shift. This chemical shift affects the phase of the MRI signal. Although ways to estimate field inhomogeneity in the presence of chemical shift have been proposed, they often rely on the a priori knowledge of the chemical spectrum. Unfortunately, variability of chemical spectra have been reported. In this dissertation, an automated joint estimation of the chemical shift and the susceptibility from an MRI dataset is reported, where the chemical shift is also treated as an unknown variable subject to optimization.
QSM may become a useful diagnostic tool for noninvasive assessment of bone health without the use of ionizing radiation, however this application has been a challenging task challenging because QSM requires complete measurements of phase everywhere within the region of interest, and cortical bone typically has very low or no signal at conventional echo times in gradient echo (GRE) imaging. An additional problem arises from intermingling of fat and water protons in the bone marrow, necessitating the application of water‚Äìfat separation techniques for field mapping. In this dissertation, a novel signal model is proposed, feasibility of using QSM for measuring bone MRI signal is investigated, and the inherent technical issues involved in this application are highlighted.
QSM has been widely applied in neuroimaging. In particular, due to its ability to accurately map iron deposits in deep brain nuclei, QSM promises precise targeting of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in deep brain stimulation surgery (DBS). This dissertation reports results of comparison between QSM and standard-of-care T2w imaging of the STN, and their performance in high-resolution presugrical anatomic imaging."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:38Z (GMT).

They make a sideways approach to protracted, polarized discussions on issues surrounding recent history and politics of memory‚Äîincluding present-day ramifications that have impact on concrete governmental policies. The critical reception of Abad, Alcoba, and Carri shows signs of an analogous turn toward polarization. I argue that such turn is unwarranted, for these works challenge our interpretive practices precisely by appeal to rhetorical strategies and innovative uses of textual performativity that preclude settling on any one reading, thus eroding the basis of any ‚Äústrong,‚Äù polarized reading. Shifts from direct report to free indirect discourse in three-person dialogue scenes, for instance, prevent us from matching utterances and speakers. In the absence of textual markers to justify one matching over others, favoring and settling on any one of them involves forcing the text into an arbitrary interpretive framework. Thus, we violate the formal structure of these texts and foreclose a more nuanced assessment demanded by the very texts: if we can‚Äôt make justified matchings, we are limited but urged to increase the projection of tentative matchings. Since each set of speaker-utterance attributions yields different scenarios, the upshot is a palette of varied interpretations of the events, actions, and characters of the same dialogue scene. This centrifugal move ‚Äì into the text‚Äîis complemented by a centripetal analogue that sends readers outside the text, into the ‚Äúreal world,‚Äù in search of missing pieces whose necessity is hinted at by the texts themselves. This requirement to restitute what is missing and unsaid also tends to go unnoticed--or ignored. Such blindness, which leads to misreading and exerting violence on texts, also plagues interpretive approaches to sociopolitical phenomena, whether their focus be current events, recent history, or memory-related issues. If sound, this assessment calls for a deep revision of our interpretive practices.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:38Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, flows associated with storm events can cause conditions that may decrease the effectiveness of the bioreactors for nitrate reduction by decreasing hydraulic retention time. Stormflow may also shift flow paths, alter chemistry, and cause sloughing of biofilm and microbes in the bioreactor. As storms can contribute significantly to annual loads of excess nitrate, the ability for management practices to address stormflow is crucial. In this research, field and lab bioreactors were observed during stormflows to compare how performance, as measured by removal rate and removal efficiency, was impacted by varied inflow hydrographs. The field study showed that removal rate significantly increased during peak flows but removal efficiency decreased both during and after storms events.  The lab study confirmed this trend and found removal rate was most closely associated with internal flow patterns. When bioreactors exhibited predominantly distributed flow rather than preferential flow, event-averaged removal rate and efficiency were both significantly higher. Both studies of novel applications of bioreactors in stormwater infrastructure demonstrated effectiveness beyond agricultural fields with removal rates higher than agricultural bioreactors. The submerged bioreactors reduced nitrate in wet detention ponds below recommended levels within one month of installation. This also reduced chlorophyll-a levels. The ditch bioreactor was able to significantly reduce nitrate loads even during stormflows despite the small size. During peak flows, instantaneous removal rate was orders of magnitude higher than previously reported. This work confirms that denitrifying bioreactors are an effective management strategy for reducing nitrate load in stormwater though peak flow rates can cause disruption of high denitrification. Wider application of bioreactors will reduce excess nitrate pollution reaching receiving water bodies and improve water quality.		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:36Z (GMT).

High capacity and low cost of sulfur in conjunction with the high surface area and intriguing chemical and mechanical properties of graphene oxide (GO) are subject to many scientific interests. For my project, GO was primary interest to improve the electrochemical performance of lithium sulfur battery as a polysulfide inhibitor and active materials anchor. In chapter 1, GO was utilized as an interlayer to capture polysulfide. GO was coated onto mesoporous carbon nanofiber using air controlled electrospray method. We analyzed the performance of Li-S battery at different reduction temperatures under N2 gas flow and found optimum performance at 300oC. In chapter 2, GO was directly coated onto celgard separator along with the conductive polymer as an effective suppressor of polysulfide diffusion. In chapter 3, GO serves as a binder and polysulfide anchor to adhere active materials onto an aluminum substrate. The fabrication was carried by air controlled electrospray process. Air controlled electrospray process showed superior performance as opposed to conventional slurry method due to unique porous mechanical structure morphology and elimination of insulating polymer binder. Our conclusion indicated that air controlled electrospray process provides novel, facile, and scalable process to develop advance lithium-sulfur cells.

For this reason, problems in wind engineering are best solved using an integration of measurements and models. This approach is used herein to answer a series of distinct research questions. The overarching objective of this work is to improve the quantification of flow parameters of relevance to the wind energy industry in heterogeneous landscapes. These landscapes include complex terrain and land-sea boundaries, turbulent flow within wind farms, and the numerical space referred to as gray zone in atmospheric modeling.
		
Focusing on the Great Lakes region, a new methodology for offshore wind resource assessment is presented, which is primarily based on in situ and remote sensing observations. It is demonstrated that a combination of distinct data sets yields a robust wind atlas and reduces the error in the final resource.
		
Seeking to better characterize wind farm aerodynamics, a new approach is proposed to increase the level of detail in low-fidelity wind turbine wake modeling. It consists of a stochastic model which moves away from the commonly used steady, axisymmetric wake modeling framework. When combined with a description for the velocity deficit distribution and used as input to a structural dynamics model, the proposed wake shape model is found to improve predictions of fluctuating loads and power.
		
Still aiming to characterize wakes, a different study is performed to quantify the level of uncertainty in wind speed retrievals when sampling a large atmospheric volume with a scanning lidar in a wind turbine wake. A high-fidelity simulation is conducted and resampled to match the field measurements, enabling for a comparison between spatially and temporally disjunct points, and what would be seen by the lidar if it could either obtain a snapshot or a true temporal mean of the same volume of air.
		
Finally, when running full physics atmospheric simulations that are nested down from the meso to the micro scale it is important to consider the treatment of the gray zone in which half the turbulence is naturally resolved by the model while the other half needs to be parameterized. Cutting edge simulation techniques are employed to investigate three different ways of approaching this problem. In one such simulation we further determine how much of the discrepancy between measured and modeled flow parameters can be attributed to wake effects."

As consumption of information shifts to digital means, systems are playing a increasing role in shaping both the information we pay attention to and the practices for paying attention. Computer scientists are uniquely positioned to explore this unprecedented opportunity to design systems that impact millions of people, and support more efficient and effective use of human attention. However, incomplete measures of online attention and little research on the determinants of attention in online settings hamper the ability to design better information systems. To this end, this dissertation develops measures and methods to investigate individuals' attention online as it manifest in two of the most important domains of online activity: online news and social media. We devise new Web scale measures for capturing individuals' attention using non-invasive digital traces of online activity. In addition, we design novel computational methodology for studying the social, cognitive, and technological factors that affect attention online. Overall, this dissertation lays the foundation for assessing the impact information systems have on human attention, and provides guidelines for the design of better information systems in the future.

The required strong nonlinear interaction between photons can be achieved by enhancing the light-matter interaction using alkali vapors interacting with a tightly confined optical mode area, such as that of a waveguide. The guiding properties of the waveguide over long distances helps in achieving a long interaction length while simultaneously increasing the atom-photon coupling by maintaining a small mode area over the entire guiding length. In this thesis, we explore the large effective Kerr nonlinearities (Œ≥) of Rubidium vapor interacting with the optical mode of hollow-core photonic band-gap fibers (Rb-PBGF) and the tightly confined evanescent field of air-clad silicon nitride  waveguides (Rb-chip). We have demonstrated efficient and noiseless frequency conversion at low power levels leveraging the large Œ≥ for the Rb-PBGF system. As proof of principle, we have also generated spectrally bright quantum correlated photon-pairs in a warm Rb vapor-cell and have proposed an extension of the experiment in the Rb-PBGF platform, which could lead to near unit photon pair generation efficiency. During the course of the study, we have also significantly improved the Rb-PBGF system by attaining an almost continuous operation lasting for several hours (1000X longer) while generating optical depths (OD's) ~ 50, which are required to attain single photon-level nonlinearity in the Rb-PBGF system.  Developing on-chip CMOS [complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor] compatible Rb vapor based platforms can not only achieve large Œ≥, but also significantly reduce the footprint of the device and make it more compatible with other chip-based platforms. In our present work, we have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by achieving extended interaction time-scales for, air-clad silicon nitride waveguides coated with aluminum oxide  and evanescently coupled to warm Rb vapor. The thin aluminum oxide layer has greatly helped in preventing corrosive damage caused by Rb to the nitride surface that have improved the operational lifetimes by a factor > 100. During the course of our study, we realized the limitations of known platforms towards generating tunable sources of single photons at near-visible wavelengths; a wavelength regime at which great progress has been made for quantum storage and detection. Towards the end of this work, we have experimentally demonstrated a broadband frequency comb at near-visible wavelengths by engineering anomalous dispersion for higher order waveguide modes in  silicon nitride microresonators. The underling process of parametric wave-mixing being the same for frequency combs and correlated photon-pair generation; our work opens new possibilities for developing spectrally narrow single photon sources in the near-visible which are compatible with highly nonlinear alkali vapor based systems like the Rb-PBGF and Rb-chip platform.

These fluids are sometimes the product of a harsh environment, as in subsurface operations such as oil and gas development or geothermal energy production, or at other times, exploited for their desirable transport and thermodynamic properties in, for example, chemical extractions and material synthesis. At these elevated conditions, many single and multi-component fluids exist in a supercritical state, where small changes in temperature and pressure cause significant property variations without induction of a phase change. A fluid‚Äôs isobaric heat capacity (Cp), a property important to most thermal processes, fluctuates strongly in the supercritical region, ranging from a few times the ideal gas state Cp to infinity exactly at the critical point for pure fluids. Accurately capturing the thermophysical behavior of supercritical pure fluids and mixtures is necessary for optimal design and efficient operation of numerous engineering processes that utilize these substances.
The main goal of this research was to increase understanding of isobaric heat capacity property changes in supercritical fluids. The first step in a threefold approach was to design and construct a calorimeter for precise and accurate measurements of Cp in the supercritical region. Second was to carry out experimental Cp measurements for pure fluids and representative fluid mixtures in pressure-temperature-composition regions with only limited available data. Systems studied included: CO2-methanol, common in supercritical fluid extraction and chemical processing; CO2-decane, relevant to tertiary recovery in oil and gas applications; and R1234yf, a low-global-warming-potential drop-in replacement refrigerant for R134a which is currently used in heat pumps and power cycles. And finally, the third step was to use equations of state and molecular simulations to extend Cp data and predict behavior in the supercritical region. 
A flow calorimeter was built to operate over a wide range of temperatures (20-150 ¬∞C), pressures (1-300 bar), and densities (1-1000 kg/m3). By precisely placing both the measurement devices and the heating element in direct contact with the fluid, and by limiting experimental heat losses through vacuum insulation and immersion of the entire apparatus in a fluidized thermal bath, the calorimeter achieved ¬±1% accurate measurements of Cp. To further our ability to model mixtures at supercritical conditions, measurements of CO2-methanol were compared to Monte Carlo molecular simulation predictions of Cp. The average absolute deviation, when compared to experiment, of the simulation results is comparable with the current state-of-the-art equation of state (4% versus 3%, respectively). However, the molecular simulations were significantly less correct predicting Cp in the near critical region where Cp was most sensitive to small changes in temperature and pressure. This region of greatest sensitivity, called the ‚Äúheat capacity ridge,‚Äù was mapped onto temperature-pressure-composition coordinates for CO2-methanol and CO2-decane using experimental measurements. For single component fluids and binary mixtures, the subtle difference in the relationship between a fluid‚Äôs heat capacity ridge and its critical point was demonstrated."

In our solar system, the abundances of water, the primary carrier of oxygen in the atmospheres of giant planets, are still unknown for all four giant planets. Juno spacecraft, currently orbiting Jupiter, has the objective of constraining Jupiter's deep water abundance (at a few bars to a hundred bars level) through microwave radiometery. A Saturn entry probe is proposed as a candidate for the New Frontiers program, with the goal of making in-situ measurements of Saturn's atmospheric composition. However, it is not likely to reach deeply enough to directly measure the deep water abundance. There are no planned missions for the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune. Disequilibrium species have long been used to constrain the deep water abundances for Jupiter and Saturn. In this dissertation, we aim to improve the chemical constraints on the deep water abundances. 
For Jupiter, we improved the chemical constraints on the deep water abundance by CO. We proposed a new formulation for the deep eddy diffusion coefficient by analyzing the experimental studies of turbulent rotating convection. We considered two updated CO kinetic models, one model constrains the water enrichment (relative to solar) to be between 0.1 and 0.75, while the other constrains the water enrichment to be between 3 and 11. Our study quantitatively accounted for the uncertainties on the constraints due to different reaction rates. We also predicted that the abundances of disequilibrium species should have latitudinal variation due to the latitudinal dependence of the eddy diffusion coefficient. Such variations have been confirmed by VLA measurements \citep{Giles16}, however, the measured dependences are different from our predictions, which merits further investigations. 
For Saturn, we proposed an approach to break the degeneracy between the deep water abundance and the deep eddy diffusion coefficient when interpreting the CO observations. We identified another disequilibrium species, C$_2$H$_6$, whose abundance only depends on the deep eddy diffusion coefficient, but not the deep water abundance. A shallow entry probe may have the ability to determine both the CO abundance and the C$_2$H$_6$ abundances through a mass spectrometer, therefore, constraining the deep water abundance and eddy diffusion coefficient simultaneously.  
The transit spectroscopy provided an opportunity for constraining the composition of extrasolar giant planets. JWST should be able to collect the highest quality transit spectra in the future. For extrasolar giant planet atmospheres we expect to measure and retrieve the abundance of the most abundant molecules, such as H$_2$O, CO, and CH$_4$. Other molecules, such as H$_2$S and PH$_3$, have been observed in Jupiter and Saturn but their chemistry and detectability in strongly irradiated planets is highly unknown. Can JWST detect them? Are they important in the chemistry for these exoplanets atmospheres? To address these questions, we model the chemistry of phosphorus and sulfur in hydrogen-rich atmospheres including the effect of vertical transport. Using the abundance profiles computed for major C/N/O/S/P bearing species, we model the JWST primary and secondary transit spectra for systems with a Sun-like star at a distance of 50 pc and with different levels of insolation. We find PH$_3$ is detectable in the transmission spectra for planets with $T_{\rm eq}$ $<$ 500 K using the NIRCam instrument with LW grism mode and F444W filter, and the H$_2$S is detectable in the transmission and emission spectra for planets with $T_{\rm eq}$ $>$ 1500 K using the NIRCam instrument with LW grism and F322W2 filter. Our results specially highlight the importance of including H$_2$S for future abundances retrieval with JWST."					"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:42Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Rural agriculturalists suffer a high burden of undernutrition and are exposed to health and nutrition risks that vary throughout the year.  Recent estimates of undernutrition based on growth from 0-6 months of age are high, but the risk factors for this poor growth are understudied. 	 	Pregnant women (n=599) were recruited from nine selected villages in Shivgarh, Uttar Pradesh for a longitudinal study.  Mother-infant pairs were visited monthly from 0-6 months of infant age.  Repeated maternal and infant health information and anthropometry were collected.   	Gestational age and maternal height were associated with larger newborn size.  Female sex, primiparity, and being food insecure were associated with smaller newborn size.  Compared to the overall sample means, infants conceived from July-September 2014 and April-June 2014 were approximately 200 g lighter (p=0.02) and 0.5 cm shorter (p=0.08), respectively.  Infants who began the 1-4 month interval of growth from August-October 2015 had rates of length growth that were 0.064 ¬± 0.016 cm/month lower (p<0.001).  We observed no monthly differences in rates of weight growth.  In the 1-4 month growth interval, female sex and maternal work in agriculture were associated with slower rates of growth.  Exclusive breastfeeding was associated with faster rates of growth.  Newborn length and maternal morbidity were associated with slower and faster rates of length growth, respectively.  Primiparity and newborn weight were associated with faster rates of weight growth (p<0.1).  Unvaccinated infants had significantly slower growth related to increased morbidity (interaction p=0.001).  Infants born from August-October 2015 had significantly slower length growth related to increased time spent in childcare (interaction p=0.019).   	This research shows that both prenatal and early postnatal determinants of poor growth contribute to small size at six months of age and confirms the important predictors of growth observed in other settings.  Season was a relatively weak predictor of growth in this setting, but may be a stronger predictor in primarily rain-fed agricultural areas.  Intervention strategies to address modifiable risk factors for poor infant growth are needed during both the prenatal and postnatal periods for positive impacts on early postnatal growth."

However, jurors are not blank slates ‚Äì by the time trial has started, eligible jurors (i.e. adults) have already accumulated strong senses of gist (intuition) built upon experience, emotion, and moral reasoning irrespective of the law. We investigate the impact of verbatim (violations of rote legal definitions) and gist (bottom-line or essence) manipulations of rape on juror decision-making.¬†Despite jury instructions, we¬†predict that legal verdicts will be influenced by gist. Conversely, we predict that verbatim manipulations will influence personal assignments of guilt such that scenarios that violate the law will be judged as more immoral or personally violating. The first experiment measured responses to scenarios involving alcohol (N = 158) and scenarios involving age disparities (N = 206). Participants received one of four combinations of two cases, giving two verdicts per case, resulting in 4 total responses. These verdicts corresponded to whether the actions in the scenario rose to the level of rape legally and personally - participants gave hard legal verdicts (guilty and not guilty) as if participants were on a jury, and personal verdicts that corresponded to personal expectations of rape (still coded as guilty/not guilty).  The presence of verbatim violations and gist violations of rape both significantly increased the rate of legal and personal verdicts, implying that 1) the gist of rape inflates legal guilty verdicts and 2) written law inflates personal opinions of what qualifies as rape while controlling for rape myth acceptance (endorsement of myths related to sexual assault and aggression). Experiment 2 (N = 258) improved upon the methods of Experiment 1. The age scenario was revised, and scenarios related to coercion and deception replaced alcohol. Overall, age-related scenarios were more influenced by verbatim, and coercion and deception were more overall influenced by gist. Follow-up studies with gender, survivor status, and law enforcement are suggested for informing relevant policy.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:39Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The critical reception of Abad, Alcoba, and Carri shows signs of an analogous turn toward polarization. I argue that such turn is unwarranted, for these works challenge our interpretive practices precisely by appeal to rhetorical strategies and innovative uses of textual performativity that preclude settling on any one reading, thus eroding the basis of any ‚Äústrong,‚Äù polarized reading. Shifts from direct report to free indirect discourse in three-person dialogue scenes, for instance, prevent us from matching utterances and speakers. In the absence of textual markers to justify one matching over others, favoring and settling on any one of them involves forcing the text into an arbitrary interpretive framework. Thus, we violate the formal structure of these texts and foreclose a more nuanced assessment demanded by the very texts: if we can‚Äôt make justified matchings, we are limited but urged to increase the projection of tentative matchings. Since each set of speaker-utterance attributions yields different scenarios, the upshot is a palette of varied interpretations of the events, actions, and characters of the same dialogue scene. This centrifugal move ‚Äì into the text‚Äîis complemented by a centripetal analogue that sends readers outside the text, into the ‚Äúreal world,‚Äù in search of missing pieces whose necessity is hinted at by the texts themselves. This requirement to restitute what is missing and unsaid also tends to go unnoticed--or ignored. Such blindness, which leads to misreading and exerting violence on texts, also plagues interpretive approaches to sociopolitical phenomena, whether their focus be current events, recent history, or memory-related issues. If sound, this assessment calls for a deep revision of our interpretive practices.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:40:52Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

While the trans acting factors that establish, maintain, and remove DNA methylation are well-known, the cis acting mechanisms that direct DNA methylation to specific genomic locations remain elusive. Two gene classes offer insights into cis-acting mechanisms for DNA methylation: imprinted loci, and transposable elements. A locus spanning both is the murine Rasgrf1 locus. Rasgrf1 has a cis element, a series of tandem repeats, required for DNA methylation, but also harbors a long noncoding RNA, the pitRNA. The pitRNA is driven by the repeats and is targeted by piRNAs, small RNAs that mediate transposable element methylation in the mammalian male germline. However, the effects of the pitRNA versus the repeats have not yet been separated. My work, where I used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate a targeted mutant system permitting inducible control of the pitRNA, is the first to query the sufficiency of the pitRNA independently. Using quantitative qPCR and targeted bisulfite sequencing, I demonstrated that expression of the lncRNA at physiological levels in the male germline is insufficient to impart DNA methylation at Rasgrf1. These findings were complimented by additional in vitro studies, where I identified Sp1 as a transcription factor that binds the repeats and is required for pitRNA expression. Sp1 binds secondary DNA structure and has recently been identified as a regulating factor at another imprinted gene. Together, these findings support an alternative, critical role for the repeats beyond their known role in regulating pitRNA expression.
Beyond mechanism, DNA methylation in the context of disease are an area of active study, though its utility in non-traditional model organisms is nascent. The second focus of my thesis speaks to this. I performed reduced representation bisulfite analysis on two dog breeds with highly diverse morphology and disease risks. While this work is largely preliminary, two differentially methylated regions have direct association with differential disease risk between these two breeds, suggesting that the canine methylome could be used as method of disease surveillance."		12/18/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:39Z (GMT).

Redox imbalance is a marker of various pathologies including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. At high levels, reactive electrophilic/oxygen/nitrogen species cause damage to cellular components such as proteins and DNA. More recently, it has come to light that at physiological concentrations the reactive species act as signaling molecules crucial for cellular communication. Given the chemical simplicity of these reactive messengers, it has been a challenge to understand how these reactive small molecules specifically perturb particular proteins‚Äîa prerequisite of redox signaling. Traditionally, redox signaling has been studied by swamping a model system (cells/whole organisms) with reactive signals leading to the generation of mixed responses from multiple simultaneous events. Such approaches mimic oxidative stress and are less amenable to the study of redox signaling. Here, I report the development and characterization of the targetable reactive electrophiles and oxidants (T-REX), a unique chemistry-based platform that (1) enables selective modification of redox-sensitive proteins with spatiotemporal precision in complex biological systems, (2) interrogates the consequences of this target-specific redox modification, and (3) allows unbiased screening for novel first-responding sensors capable of sensing reactive redox signals under signal-limited conditions. As proof-of-concept, I show that T-REX can selectively modify Keap1, an established electrophile-sensitive protein and an important regulator of the therapeutically-relevant Nrf2/antioxidant response (Nrf2/AR) signaling axis, with the model electrophile 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). Additionally, my work for the first time shows that low stoichiometry HNE modification of Keap1 is sufficient to trigger AR in biological systems. This work also expands the applicability of T-REX to study redox signaling in zebrafish (Z-REX) and E. coli. I report here that selective modification of Keap1 in zebrafish suppresses innate and adaptive immune response.  Finally, my collaborative work also shows that T-REX can be used to screen for novel first-responding redox sensors. I show that Akt3, an isoform of the Akt oncogenic kinase, senses electrophilic signals using a unique cysteine residue in the flexible linker region of the enzyme. HNE modification of Akt3 downregulates its kinase activity with functional signaling consequences in cells and zebrafish.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:38Z (GMT).

At the time the actor forms her intention, her perspective is a general one, encompassing a range of possible circumstances that cannot be narrowed or fully specified in advance of action.  At time of action, the actor's perspective is particularized, with more evidence available about reasons for action.  
	This difference in perspective presents a dilemma for rational agents.  In many contexts, reliable advance planning has great value.  It allows for intra-personal and interpersonal coordination and minimizes bias in favor of salient or emotionally charged facts.  At the time of action, additional evidence about the context of the act clarifies, or appears to clarify, current reasons for action.
	I describe this dilemma in two contexts: rule-following and promissory commitment. In each case there may be significant practical reasons for agents to stand by their original intentions, treating them as exclusionary reasons for action. Yet, if the agent revisits her intentions at the time of action, her reasons for action may support, or appear to support, a change in course.
	I begin by examining theories of practical rationality that extend rationality over time and thus permit agents to act on their initial intentions.  Understood in this way, practical rationality may require agents to follow rules or honor promises without further consideration of reasons for action.  I argue, however, that on a plausible understanding of epistemic rationality and epistemic responsibility to respond to evidence, acting without reflection may be epistemically irrational. If this is correct, then the dilemma of general and particular decisionmaking persists, and affects important aspects of human life.  We manage only by being imperfectly irrational."

Although several proof of-concept devices have been demonstrated recently with exfoliated micron size flakes, controllable growth of large-area electronic grade material, essential for mass production, is in its infancy. Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) holds the promise to allow layer controlled uniform growth and precision in doping TMD materials. To this end, we have explored the MBE growth of WSe2, SnSe2, MoSe2, MoTe2, MoSe2-xTex, NbSe2, h-BN, and their heterostructures and superlattices.
We have investigated the growth regime for obtaining layer-by-layer growth of phase pure material. Using a plethora of characterization techniques, we elucidated the limitations of various techniques to probe different layered materials. By understanding the effect of growth conditions on grain shape and size, supported by theory, we achieved 10x improvement in grain size and transition from isotropic or dendritic growth to triangular grain growth. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy measurements, the air and thermal
stability of the MBE grown materials was studied. Electrical conductivity and workfunction of MBE grown SnSe2 and WSe2 was probed for tunnel FET application. Further for device applications, rotational alignment, interfacial reaction and strain in heterostructures of 2D materials are of key importance and these were also studied.
Finally, along side the above stated understanding, we will also present our recent ongoing work on metal organic molecular beam epitaxy (MOMBE) of WSe2 using a supersonic molecular beam of W(CO)6 and in-situ characterization using XRF and GI-XRD during growth."		9/11/22	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:41Z (GMT).

Our lab discovered two highly homologous SET domain containing genes, set-9 and set-26, in an RNAi screen of putative histone methyltransferases that regulate lifespan in C. elegans. Inactivating set-9/set-26 consistently extends lifespan. However, both the molecular functions of SET-9 and SET-26 and whether they are also involved in other biological processes are largely unknown. My work found that SET-26 but not SET-9 plays an important role in lifespan regulation. Endogenous SET-26 is broadly expressed while SET-9 is only detectable in the germline. Specifically, somatically expressed SET-26 is implicated in lifespan determination. Transcriptional profile revealed that the somatic SET-26 regulated DAF-16-dependent genes are enriched for lifespan determinant genes, which likely explain the long-lived lifespan phenotype of set-26 mutant. Moreover, SET-9 and SET-26 act redundantly to regulate germline function. Molecular analyses showed that SET-9 and SET-26 bind to H3K4me3 both in vitro and in vivo. Germline-expressed SET-9 and SET-26 normally bind to and restrict H3K4me3. Loss of SET-9 and SET-26 causes spreading of this mark with a bias towards 3‚Äô end. The spreading of H3K4me3 correlates with elevated expression of a group of germline specific genes, which could explain the fertility defect in the set-9 set-26 double mutant. In addition to longevity and germline function, I found that SET-26 is also involved in RNAi-mediated gene silencing. SET-26 is required for dsRNA-induced H3K9me3 but not H3K27me3 deposition. SET-9 and SET-26 are putative homologs of the human protein Mixed Lineage Leukemia 5 (hMLL5), which plays an important role in regulating hematopoietic homeostasis, cell cycle and survival. However, the molecular basis underlying hMLL5 activity is still unknown. Our findings on SET-9 and SET-26 will help us better understand the role of hMLL5 in human and also implicated hMLL5 in germline function and longevity.  2018			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:38Z (GMT).

However, jurors are not blank slates ‚Äì by the time trial has started, eligible jurors (i.e. adults) have already accumulated strong senses of gist (intuition) built upon experience, emotion, and moral reasoning irrespective of the law. We investigate the impact of verbatim (violations of rote legal definitions) and gist (bottom-line or essence) manipulations of rape on juror decision-making.¬†Despite jury instructions, we¬†predict that legal verdicts will be influenced by gist. Conversely, we predict that verbatim manipulations will influence personal assignments of guilt such that scenarios that violate the law will be judged as more immoral or personally violating. The first experiment measured responses to scenarios involving alcohol (N = 158) and scenarios involving age disparities (N = 206). Participants received one of four combinations of two cases, giving two verdicts per case, resulting in 4 total responses. These verdicts corresponded to whether the actions in the scenario rose to the level of rape legally and personally - participants gave hard legal verdicts (guilty and not guilty) as if participants were on a jury, and personal verdicts that corresponded to personal expectations of rape (still coded as guilty/not guilty).  The presence of verbatim violations and gist violations of rape both significantly increased the rate of legal and personal verdicts, implying that 1) the gist of rape inflates legal guilty verdicts and 2) written law inflates personal opinions of what qualifies as rape while controlling for rape myth acceptance (endorsement of myths related to sexual assault and aggression). Experiment 2 (N = 258) improved upon the methods of Experiment 1. The age scenario was revised, and scenarios related to coercion and deception replaced alcohol. Overall, age-related scenarios were more influenced by verbatim, and coercion and deception were more overall influenced by gist. Follow-up studies with gender, survivor status, and law enforcement are suggested for informing relevant policy.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:40:53Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Although New York is not a leading wool state, a vibrant fiber community persists. There are over 470 fiber farms in New York with sheep, alpacas, and goats that produce a variety of fibers such as wool, alpaca, mohair, and even cashmere. Several fiber processing mills have emerged to transform raw fibers into finished products for clothing and textile design. This research uses Actor Network Theory as a framework based on the idea that all entities are equally important including people, animals, and objects for design practice. Three major case study themes include historical, contemporary, and practice-based approaches. Methods include archival, qualitative survey, interview, and observational approaches. Findings from historic and contemporary research reveal that fiber farming has always been economically difficult. Major challenges faced by farmers in both contexts include difficulty reaching a consistent market and rural geography. A difference today is that women predominantly own fiber farms. Like predecessor farmers, they develop innovative approaches to address key challenges that includes developing fiber mills and fiber festivals. Several New York artisan designers are interested in sourcing local fibers. While some consistently source fibers, others struggle to identify consistent sources. Inspired by the research process, this study includes three practice-based approaches. The first is collaboration in a Fiber Sorting, Grading, and Classing Apprenticeship to learn about fiber quality for scaled production. The second is the development of a New York Regional Yarn Sourcebook as a resource for artisan designers to find farms. And the third involves the development of farm-to-fashion short films to expand awareness of fiber farms. Aligned with slow fashion, farmers hope that demand for local fibers increases to bring a local clothing and textiles economy into fruition. The development of an umbrella New York Fibershed and collaboration with Cornell Cooperative Extension may provide a centralized source of information about farms, fibers, and textiles for New York City designers interested in sourcing local fibers. This research provides a model for future research that explores the intersection of slow fashion and agriculture.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:42Z (GMT).

Previous research has demonstrated that perceived partner responsiveness is an essential component of close relationships that predicts emotional and physical well-being. However, not all the people benefit from having a responsive partner to the same degree. Motivated by vantage sensitivity hypothesis, the current study examined heart rate variability (HRV) as a potential vantage resource that moderates the link between perceived partner responsiveness and hedonic and eudaimonic well-being ten years later using the second and third waves of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) dataset. Longitudinal analyses revealed that there was no significant interaction between heart rate variability and perceived partner responsiveness in predicting either hedonic or eudaimonic well-being. These findings are first to test vantage sensitivity hypothesis in the context of romantic relationships.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:43Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Animal source foods (ASF) can improve children‚Äôs dietary quality, micronutrient intake, and nutrition outcomes, but ASF are often inaccessible and unaffordable for the most vulnerable children. Livestock interventions can increase the accessibility of ASF in remote, low-income communities, but evidence that they effectively improve child nutrition remains inconclusive. We therefore aimed to examine the association between household livestock ownership and child nutrition outcomes and evaluate the impact of two targeted poultry interventions in rural communities in the Luangwa Valley, Zambia.
First, we utilized multiple data sources to assess the impact of interventions addressing health and management constraints in the existing ‚Äúvillage chicken‚Äù production system. Our analyses revealed that the interventions resulted in improved flock sizes and profits, but had no impact on household consumption of chickens or eggs, because farmers preferred to sell chickens. Then, in a large cross-sectional survey, we similarly found that owning livestock managed in traditional systems was not associated with improved dietary or nutrition outcomes among children. Building off these studies, we implemented a novel, market-based intervention supporting egg production centers (EPCs) in 24 communities. Using mixed methods, we found that, despite programmatic challenges, the EPCs could be adequately productive and profitable, widely acceptable to participants, and practical to implement in most rural communities in the Luangwa Valley. Finally, in an impact evaluation, we found that the EPC program successfully increased the acquisition and consumption of eggs by households, women, and young children in participating communities.
In this dissertation, we took a comprehensive and stepwise approach, utilizing conceptual frameworks and program impact pathways to identify and test underlying assumptions and intermediate outcomes on the hypothesized pathway from livestock to child nutrition. We suggest that the novel EPC program could function as one component of an integrated nutrition intervention to enhance access to, and consumption of, high-quality ASF in vulnerable households. Our results contribute to the growing evidence that livestock can enhance child nutrition and point to a new approach for livestock interventions and evaluations that focuses on impact at the community-level."		12/18/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:41Z (GMT).

However, a subset of cargo carriers, primarily membrane tubules, form independently of coat proteins in a process that remains poorly understood. In an siRNA screen of the human kinome, our lab identified diacylglycerol kinase Œ≥ (DGKŒ≥) as important in the generation of coat-independent tubular cargo carriers at the Golgi complex and trans Golgi Network (TGN). DGKs converts diacylglycerol (DAG) into phosphatidic acid (PA). Both DAG and PA are signaling lipids known to regulate different steps in trafficking at the Golgi, and a role for DGKs has been anticipated but remains unclear. Here we show that drug- or siRNA-mediated inhibition of DGKŒ≥ reduced delivery of a subset of cargoes to the plasma membrane. Inhibition of DGKŒ≥ also caused fragmentation of the Golgi complex, a characteristic phenotype of inhibitors of intra Golgi trafficking, as Golgi structure homeostasis depends on continuous membrane tubule formation between cisternae. Furthermore, we found a novel interaction of DGKŒ≥ with the regulatory and catalytic subunits of PPP6, as well as the Rab GEF, DENND4C, both of which contribute to trafficking out of the Golgi and may thus suggest a mechanism for DGKŒ≥ in this process. Our findings implicate DGKŒ≥ as a regulator of trafficking at the Golgi and TGN via a novel role in tubule formation, with several compelling mechanistic possibilities to unravel.

Phloridzin, the primary dihydrochalcone in Malus species, has beneficial nutritional qualities, including antioxidant, anti-cancer, and anti-diabetic properties. As such, phloridzin could be a target for improvement of nutritional quality in new apple cultivars. In addition to phloridzin, a few rare Malus species produce trilobatin or sieboldin in place of phloridzin and hybridization can lead to combinations of phloridzin, trilobatin, or sieboldin in interspecific apple progenies. Trilobatin and sieboldin also have unique chemical properties that make them desirable targets for apple breeding, including high antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic properties, and a high sweetness intensity. We studied the variation of phloridzin, sieboldin, and trilobatin content in leaves of 377 accessions from the USDA National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) Malus collection in Geneva, NY over three seasons and identified valuable genetic resources for breeding and researching dihydrochalcones. From these resources, five apple hybrid populations were developed to determine the genetic basis of dihydrochalcone variation. Phloridzin, sieboldin, and trilobatin appear to follow segregation patterns for three independent genes and significant trait-marker associations were identified using genetic data from genotyping-by-sequencing. 
Dihydrochalcones are at much lower quantities in mature apple fruit compared with vegetative tissues. Within the fruit, phloridzin is more concentrated in the peel than in the flesh. We observed higher phloridzin content in the peel of russet apples compared to the peel of non-russet apples. Russet is a disorder affecting the development of the fruit cuticle, causing a smooth waxy surface to be replaced by a rough, russet colored layer. We compared leaf, and fruit peel and flesh samples from 108 accessions in the USDA-NPGS Malus collection and identified a strong correlation between percent russeting and phloridzin content the fruit peel, especially in sport families with variation for russeting. Though russeting can severely impact commercial value of apple cultivars, russeted fruit have a unique nutritional profile compared to non-russet cultivars."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:42Z (GMT).

In this dissertation I examine how changes in the financial sector over the past thirty years reconfigured urban and suburban development. I take three different approaches to these issues. The first paper describes the role of large financial firms in the rapid growth of local and regional homebuilding companies during the 1990s, a period during which a handful of homebuilders became increasingly national in scale and captured a significant share of large, fast-growing markets in cities like Las Vegas and Phoenix during the 2000s. Among my conclusions, I suggest that homebuilders may have overbuilt in the mid-2000s to meet the annual growth targets of their stock analysts rather than the needs of subprime mortgage packagers. The essay also offers an argument that housing economists should consider firm and local market structure when studying housing supply and housing bubbles. The second paper is a case study of the real estate investments of U.S. life insurance companies, who for much of the twentieth century wrote one-third of the mortgages that financed the building of suburban malls, office buildings, apartments, etc., in the United States. I trace how firms began to lose market share in the 1970s and 1980s as pension rules and savings habits changed, and show how these factors led to changes in life insurance products, which, in turn, required different investment choices and a loosening of lending standards for large properties. My third paper argues that planners should understand commercial (non-single-family-residential) properties in the suburbs as embedded in a series of local, regional, and global networks tied to both real estate and the specific networks of the tenants, and offers a set of questions for planners to ask to help ascertain the intentions of owners and developers.   The paper uses the example of suburban properties in the retail sector as an example.  These three essays are based on large financial databases, trade periodicals, analyst reports, and archival research, and draw on the literatures from planning, geography, business history, economics and sociology.  A conclusion discusses some of the implications of the research for planners.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:43Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Although several proof of-concept devices have been demonstrated recently with exfoliated micron size flakes, controllable growth of large-area electronic grade material, essential for mass production, is in its infancy. Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) holds the promise to allow layer controlled uniform growth and precision in doping TMD materials. To this end, we have explored the MBE growth of WSe2, SnSe2, MoSe2, MoTe2, MoSe2-xTex, NbSe2, h-BN, and their heterostructures and superlattices.
We have investigated the growth regime for obtaining layer-by-layer growth of phase pure material. Using a plethora of characterization techniques, we elucidated the limitations of various techniques to probe different layered materials. By understanding the effect of growth conditions on grain shape and size, supported by theory, we achieved 10x improvement in grain size and transition from isotropic or dendritic growth to triangular grain growth. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy measurements, the air and thermal
stability of the MBE grown materials was studied. Electrical conductivity and workfunction of MBE grown SnSe2 and WSe2 was probed for tunnel FET application. Further for device applications, rotational alignment, interfacial reaction and strain in heterostructures of 2D materials are of key importance and these were also studied.
Finally, along side the above stated understanding, we will also present our recent ongoing work on metal organic molecular beam epitaxy (MOMBE) of WSe2 using a supersonic molecular beam of W(CO)6 and in-situ characterization using XRF and GI-XRD during growth."		9/11/22	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:40:56Z (GMT).

patterns is Dictyostelium discoideum (D.d.). When nutrients are available
in plenty, D.d. lead solitary lives - they feed and divide. However, when a population
of D.d. begins to starve, the cells become social. Each cell emits a chemical
called cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which diffuses in the medium.
When neighboring cells detect cAMP, they also secrete cAMP. An enzyme phosphodiesterase,
secreted by the cells, degrades cAMP. The system is therefore a
reaction-diffusion system. After a few hours of signaling, the response of the
cells to cAMP is seen either as large scale spiral waves or target patterns. The
waves persist for about 2h. Towards the end, the cells aggregate towards the
centers of the spirals and targets through chemotaxis and form mounds. These
mounds can form multi-cellular slugs which move around looking for food.
Failing to find food, the slug transforms into a fruiting body with spores on the
top. D.d. is thus a unique organism that exhibits unicellular and multicellular
behavior.
In this thesis, I analyze the effect of various parameters on the patterns
formed by D.d.. As D.d. starves, its internal biochemistry changes. This developmental
changes drastically affect the patterns. I will present results of a
systematic analysis of the effects of the developmental path on pattern formation.
Next, I considered the effects of variability in parameters in a population
on the patterns. By mixing two populations at different developmental stages, I
introduced developmental variability in the population and found that the patterns
depend on the heterogeneity in the biochemical parameters and in spatial
distribution of cells. By modifying an existing model, by introducing temporal
variations of certain biochemical parameters, I was able to simulate the experimental
results. Further, using the simulations I was able to determine that the
dynamics of the starving populations changes from being excitable to oscillatory.
This work proved that a systematic analysis of patterns can provide information
about the developmental pathways in a system. Using the idea that populations
at different developmental stages form different patterns, I performed
experiments to check for the existence of ‚Äúmemory.‚Äù Indeed, I found that populations
have a memory of starvation for about 1 h. These results indicate that
the biochemical parameters do not deregulate at the same time. Simulations of
the model that I modified confirmed this analysis.
In a population, the amount of cAMP produced by cells varies. Despite this
variation, the signaling mechanism is robust. Experiments to understand this
robustness revealed that signaling can occur at very low amounts of cAMP. In
fact, when a low density population of wild type cells that could not aggregate
on its own was mixed with a high density population of mutants that could
not produce cAMP, the resulting mixture aggregates. Counterintuitively, rather
than a lack of cAMP, this effect was because of insufficient amount of the enzyme,
phosphodiesterase, which degrades cAMP. Estimates of the degradation
rates confirm that phosphodiesterase is necessary for wave propagation.
In nature, the cells have to survive on various kinds of substrates. To understand
the importance of substrates for pattern formation, I performed experiments
to observe their effects. I used agar gels of various densities as the
substrate and found that as the density of the agar substrate increased the patterns
needed more time to form, and a transition from spirals to targets was
observed. However, if the cells are immersed in larger amounts of buffer, the
effect vanishes. I hypothesize that this could mean that the thin layer of buffer
over the cells is very important.
In all the simulations, I have varied the parameters by hand. To establish
a mathematically rigorous method to estimate the parameters, I have worked
with different methods of coupling data to models to optimize the parameters."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:43Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, a subset of cargo carriers, primarily membrane tubules, form independently of coat proteins in a process that remains poorly understood. In an siRNA screen of the human kinome, our lab identified diacylglycerol kinase Œ≥ (DGKŒ≥) as important in the generation of coat-independent tubular cargo carriers at the Golgi complex and trans Golgi Network (TGN). DGKs converts diacylglycerol (DAG) into phosphatidic acid (PA). Both DAG and PA are signaling lipids known to regulate different steps in trafficking at the Golgi, and a role for DGKs has been anticipated but remains unclear. Here we show that drug- or siRNA-mediated inhibition of DGKŒ≥ reduced delivery of a subset of cargoes to the plasma membrane. Inhibition of DGKŒ≥ also caused fragmentation of the Golgi complex, a characteristic phenotype of inhibitors of intra Golgi trafficking, as Golgi structure homeostasis depends on continuous membrane tubule formation between cisternae. Furthermore, we found a novel interaction of DGKŒ≥ with the regulatory and catalytic subunits of PPP6, as well as the Rab GEF, DENND4C, both of which contribute to trafficking out of the Golgi and may thus suggest a mechanism for DGKŒ≥ in this process. Our findings implicate DGKŒ≥ as a regulator of trafficking at the Golgi and TGN via a novel role in tubule formation, with several compelling mechanistic possibilities to unravel.

This study seeks to extend this line of research to relationship outcomes and specifically marital outcomes to see if individual differences in negative affective reactivity can predict these outcomes. Additionally, recent findings have shown links between negative affective reactivity (AR) and high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), an index of cardiac vagal control. An additional goal was to determine whether HF-HRV moderated the relationship between negative AR and marital quality. We used data from 344 participants who took part in waves II and III of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS). Respondents completed daily diary measures of stress and affect, a psychophysiological procedure that included HF-HRV measures at rest, and survey scales on marital quality and covariates. We found that negative AR significantly predicted marital risk and marital satisfaction 10 years later and that this relationship was moderated by HF-HRV, which served as a stress buffer.		6/8/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:44Z (GMT).

Among these, imaging radars are developed as a reliable and cheap measurement technique for short-range remote sensing applications. Terahertz radiation has several distinct advantages over other wavelengths of light such as: 1) many dielectric materials are transparent to Terahertz radiation; 2) Terahertz radiation is nonionizing and consequently safe for biological tissues unlike X-ray, 3) Terahertz images have a relatively high lateral resolution ‚âà1 mm. These advantages make the terahertz imaging intriguing. There are optical devices for these applications however, they are bulky and expensive solutions. A silicon chip can cover THz advantages at a lower price and a more scalable scheme. However, there are challenges on fully integration of a radar system on silicon. These challenges includes efficient power generation, low sensitivity of the Rx. front end, generation of ultra-wideband signals, long image acquisition time and finally putting together all the building blocks of a radar transceiver in a single chip.  In this thesis, we have demonstrated three integrated radars at THz frequencies, which exhibits the feasibility of low cost, low power and fully integrated silicon-imaging instrumentation for future 2D and 3D practical imaging applications, such as biomedical hydration sensing, security screening and industrial quality control. We have demonstrated systems, which are capable of practical biomedical hydration sensing applications. The system is tested for contactless detection of skin burn with a high resolution. In chapter 1, A 320 GHz fully integrated transmission-based THz imaging system is reported. The system is composed of a phase locked high-power transmitter and a coherent high-sensitivity subharmonic-mixing receiver. To enhance the imaging sensitivity, a heterodyne coherent detection scheme is utilized. To obtain frequency coherency, fully integrated phase-locked loops are implemented on both the transmitter and receiver chips. In chapter 2 a 170GHz, fully integrated single-chip heterodyne FMCW imaging radar is reported. We have propose a design methodology to maximize the tuning range of the VCO. A co-design of the VCO, coupler and antenna is performed to minimize the chip area and the DC power consumption. The prototype is capable of forming 2D and 3D images with a range resolution of 7.0mm. The structure is quite compact with a total Si area of only 0.7mm^2.  In chapter  3, 4,an ultra-wideband fully integrated imaging radar at THz frequencies is presented which demonstrates a fine lateral resolution without using any focal lens/mirror. We have achieved a lateral resolution of 2mm for an object at 23cm distance as well as a range resolution of 2.7 mm. To achieve the decent range resolution, in a FMCW radar configuration, a state-of-the-art chirp bandwidth of 62.4GHz at a center frequency of 221.1GHz is generated and efficiently radiated. By optimal design of the passive embedding around the core transistor the tuning bandwidth of the radiator is maximized. At the receiver side to maximize the IF level a sub-harmonic mixer is utilized which is designed for the lowest conversion loss. Finally, to obtain the fine lateral resolution, we have implemented near-field beamforming algorithm based on the ISAR systems. In chapter 5, an array implementation of the FMCW radar is reported. Using the array structure electrical beam forming becomes practical. In the proposed array structure, 8 pixels at the receiver side are used that are capable of digital beam steering. The array is used in focal plane and plane wave imaging schemes. We have shown that by using the signals from all the pixels we can lower the number of mechanical movements significantly by a factor of 16 while the image quality is not degraded. This makes the imaging faster by almost the same factor.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:44Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

It is full of phenomena that transcend dimensionality (these provocative statements will be clarified). It could inform new generations of compact, cost-efficient scientific tools, or major upgrades to optical fiber telecommunications. These advances in foundational, infrastructural technologies would have major impact on the human world, from science and knowledge through to the economic engine of the internet. In this thesis, I examine the work of my PhD that has explored nonlinear pulse propagation in multimode fibers. Both as a microcosm of science, a mostly-mundane story of half-reasoned exploration, and as a rich and complex world of observed phenomena and inspired applications, here I attempt to retrospectively describe the work and science in as coherent a summary form as can be managed at this point. We examine first multimode solitons in anomalous dispersion fibers. These are stable configurations of light in nonlinear multimode fiber and, in some sense, the conceptual building blocks or framework through which we can understand much more complex dynamics of multimode supercontinuum generation. We then examine the complex mode coupling in nonlinear, disordered multimode fibers, and attempt to integrate the multitude of effects into a cohesive framework of modal energy flow. Finally, we explore multimode fiber lasers and spatiotemporal mode-locking, the most general form of coherent light self-organization in an optical oscillator.		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:45Z (GMT).

Phloridzin, the primary dihydrochalcone in Malus species, has beneficial nutritional qualities, including antioxidant, anti-cancer, and anti-diabetic properties. As such, phloridzin could be a target for improvement of nutritional quality in new apple cultivars. In addition to phloridzin, a few rare Malus species produce trilobatin or sieboldin in place of phloridzin and hybridization can lead to combinations of phloridzin, trilobatin, or sieboldin in interspecific apple progenies. Trilobatin and sieboldin also have unique chemical properties that make them desirable targets for apple breeding, including high antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic properties, and a high sweetness intensity. We studied the variation of phloridzin, sieboldin, and trilobatin content in leaves of 377 accessions from the USDA National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) Malus collection in Geneva, NY over three seasons and identified valuable genetic resources for breeding and researching dihydrochalcones. From these resources, five apple hybrid populations were developed to determine the genetic basis of dihydrochalcone variation. Phloridzin, sieboldin, and trilobatin appear to follow segregation patterns for three independent genes and significant trait-marker associations were identified using genetic data from genotyping-by-sequencing. 
Dihydrochalcones are at much lower quantities in mature apple fruit compared with vegetative tissues. Within the fruit, phloridzin is more concentrated in the peel than in the flesh. We observed higher phloridzin content in the peel of russet apples compared to the peel of non-russet apples. Russet is a disorder affecting the development of the fruit cuticle, causing a smooth waxy surface to be replaced by a rough, russet colored layer. We compared leaf, and fruit peel and flesh samples from 108 accessions in the USDA-NPGS Malus collection and identified a strong correlation between percent russeting and phloridzin content the fruit peel, especially in sport families with variation for russeting. Though russeting can severely impact commercial value of apple cultivars, russeted fruit have a unique nutritional profile compared to non-russet cultivars."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:40:58Z (GMT).

Repeated consumption of palatable, high calorie foods contributes to obesity, one of the most pressing health concerns of our time. Recent reports suggest that taste is weakened in overweight or obese people, although it is unknown whether this dysfunction in the taste system is linked with compensatory eating behaviors to attain satisfactory reward. In a repeated measure study, we showed that those with weakened gustatory signals desired more intensely tasting and higher calorie stimuli. Building upon previous research, we demonstrated longitudinally that a modest weight gain over 8 months associated with decreases in sweet and salty tastes, primarily observed in males of a college-aged population. In the same study, we also found that changes in the consumption of umami-rich foods selectively correlated with umami taste perception. Aiming to clarify this relationship, we conducted a randomized controlled study to show that adaptive changes may occur in the taste system with prolonged exposure to the umami-rich stimuli, monosodium glutamate (MSG). After one month of exposure to MSG, females decreased in their sensitivity to umami taste, while both sexes experienced a lessened appetite for savory foods. Seeking to determine how taste may be connected to emotional eating, a large cross-sectional study evaluated the effect of day-to-day emotional variation on taste function and food liking after college hockey games.  Analysis revealed that negative emotions correlated with diminished sweet and enhanced sour perception, and also affected hedonic responses to food. Taken together, our results suggest that weight gain, diet, and emotions can independently influence the taste system, while effect often varies by sex. We supply evidence that decrements in taste may impact food preferences and eating behavior, potentially encouraging the consumption of higher calorie foods. With this in mind, our research provides support that taste and taste dysfunction should be considered in the complex multicomponent etiology of obesity and other diet-related diseases.

In budding yeast, a single actin monomer pool is used to build both actin cables involved in polarized growth and actin cortical patches involved in endocytosis. Here I report how Aim21/Tda2 is recruited to the membrane-proximal region of actin patches, how it negatively regulates actin assembly at patches to elevate the available actin monomer pool, and how an array of actin regulators is orchestrated to ensure proper assembly of both structures.
Aim21 has four polyproline regions and is recruited to actin patches by two SH3-containing patch proteins Bbc1 and Abp1. The C-terminal region, which is required for its function, binds to Tda2. Cell biological and biochemical data reveal that Aim21/Tda2 is a negative regulator of barbed end F-actin assembly and plays a pivotal role in balancing the distribution of actin between cables and patches, demonstrated by the rescue of the growth defect of tpm1Œî cells by aim21Œî. Additionally, this activity is necessary for efficient endocytosis. Aim21/Tda2 forms a complex with the F-actin barbed end capping protein Cap1/Cap2, revealing an interplay between regulators, and illustrating the complexity of regulation of barbed end assembly."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:44Z (GMT).

International agricultural trade are often affected by policies in importing and exporting countries. These policies can be directly or indirectly imposed on the production inputs. It is important to understand the markets‚Äô responses in both importing and exporting countries to the policies changes through vertical linkages between the input and output markets. This dissertation provides three essays to study this topic from the prospective of importer, exporter, input market, output market, and trade negotiation mechanism. 
 Essay 1 studies a European Union trade policy induced technological innovation, specifically on its impact on the U.S. apple markets. I adopt the Ex Ante approach to simulate the market reaction to both the European Union policy change and the technological innovation. The research finds that the policy induced technological innovation benefits the outputs that are intensive in the policy affected input. The methodology and conclusion contribute to research on markets with highly differentiated products.
Essay 2 is motivated by the decade-long cotton dispute between Brazil and the United States. The dispute was arbitrated based on several domestic policies of the United States. This chapter analyzes the impact of a U.S. domestic policy on 1) land re-allocation with a difference-in difference model; 2) international cotton trade between the United States and the rest of world including Brazil with a partial equilibrium simulation model. Based on the analysis, I find limited policy impact of removing this particularly U.S. domestic policy on international cotton trade. The result is consistent to the World Trade Organization arbitration of the dispute. 
Essay 3 summarizes three most common methods of quantifying the trade impact of non-tariff trade measures in the literature. I carefully compare the advantages and disadvantages between each method. A guidance of how to choose an appropriate method based on the characteristic of a non-tariff trade measure is summarized. To illustrate the guidance, I show a real example of apple trade with non-tariff trade measure imposed by the European Union."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:45Z (GMT).

Thousands are known, with dozens of new ones being discovered every week. Yet the physical characterization of near-Earth asteroids lags well behind discovery. Studying some asteroids in detail helps to reveal the properties of the overall population. This work focuses on the detailed characterization of a few specific near-Earth asteroids with high-quality data sets, particularly radar observations that can be used to determine their shapes and rotation states. Incorporating multiple types of observational data enables much better characterization than could be done with any single data set.
Chapter 2: For (162421) 2000 ET70, incorporating lightcurves that had not been used for the modeling of Naidu et al. (2013) allows a better determination of its dimensions and rotation state. Incorporating infrared spectra further refines ET70's rotation state, since thermal modeling shows that some pole directions that provide good fits to the radar and lightcurve data are not compatible with the infrared observations. Thermal modeling also indicates that ET70's surface is heterogeneous, since no thermal model with uniform surface properties could provide an adequate fit to all of the infrared spectra.
Chapter 3: (85989) 1999 JD6 was observed to have a large amplitude in visible and infrared lightcurves, suggesting that it is a highly elongated body. Radar images obtained during JD6's close approach in 2015 confirm this, revealing a contact binary with a maximum breadth of 3.0 km. Due to fortuitous observing geometry during some of the radar observations, its rotation state can be determined to great accuracy. The direction of JD6's rotation axis is known more accurately than that of any other asteroid for which only Earth-based observations are available.
Chapter 4: One promising way to speed up part of the asteroid shape modeling process is by using Bayesian optimization to test pole directions autonomously. This requires less computational time and less human oversight than a traditional grid search."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:46Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

patterns is Dictyostelium discoideum (D.d.). When nutrients are available
in plenty, D.d. lead solitary lives - they feed and divide. However, when a population
of D.d. begins to starve, the cells become social. Each cell emits a chemical
called cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which diffuses in the medium.
When neighboring cells detect cAMP, they also secrete cAMP. An enzyme phosphodiesterase,
secreted by the cells, degrades cAMP. The system is therefore a
reaction-diffusion system. After a few hours of signaling, the response of the
cells to cAMP is seen either as large scale spiral waves or target patterns. The
waves persist for about 2h. Towards the end, the cells aggregate towards the
centers of the spirals and targets through chemotaxis and form mounds. These
mounds can form multi-cellular slugs which move around looking for food.
Failing to find food, the slug transforms into a fruiting body with spores on the
top. D.d. is thus a unique organism that exhibits unicellular and multicellular
behavior.
In this thesis, I analyze the effect of various parameters on the patterns
formed by D.d.. As D.d. starves, its internal biochemistry changes. This developmental
changes drastically affect the patterns. I will present results of a
systematic analysis of the effects of the developmental path on pattern formation.
Next, I considered the effects of variability in parameters in a population
on the patterns. By mixing two populations at different developmental stages, I
introduced developmental variability in the population and found that the patterns
depend on the heterogeneity in the biochemical parameters and in spatial
distribution of cells. By modifying an existing model, by introducing temporal
variations of certain biochemical parameters, I was able to simulate the experimental
results. Further, using the simulations I was able to determine that the
dynamics of the starving populations changes from being excitable to oscillatory.
This work proved that a systematic analysis of patterns can provide information
about the developmental pathways in a system. Using the idea that populations
at different developmental stages form different patterns, I performed
experiments to check for the existence of ‚Äúmemory.‚Äù Indeed, I found that populations
have a memory of starvation for about 1 h. These results indicate that
the biochemical parameters do not deregulate at the same time. Simulations of
the model that I modified confirmed this analysis.
In a population, the amount of cAMP produced by cells varies. Despite this
variation, the signaling mechanism is robust. Experiments to understand this
robustness revealed that signaling can occur at very low amounts of cAMP. In
fact, when a low density population of wild type cells that could not aggregate
on its own was mixed with a high density population of mutants that could
not produce cAMP, the resulting mixture aggregates. Counterintuitively, rather
than a lack of cAMP, this effect was because of insufficient amount of the enzyme,
phosphodiesterase, which degrades cAMP. Estimates of the degradation
rates confirm that phosphodiesterase is necessary for wave propagation.
In nature, the cells have to survive on various kinds of substrates. To understand
the importance of substrates for pattern formation, I performed experiments
to observe their effects. I used agar gels of various densities as the
substrate and found that as the density of the agar substrate increased the patterns
needed more time to form, and a transition from spirals to targets was
observed. However, if the cells are immersed in larger amounts of buffer, the
effect vanishes. I hypothesize that this could mean that the thin layer of buffer
over the cells is very important.
In all the simulations, I have varied the parameters by hand. To establish
a mathematically rigorous method to estimate the parameters, I have worked
with different methods of coupling data to models to optimize the parameters."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:40:59Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Just as St Boniface reportedly held up a scriptural manuscript at his moment of martyrdom to protect himself from the sword, medieval readers saw their books, and the texts contained within them, as spiritual and physical protection against devilish attacks. Not only were texts adapted and manipulated by redactors for defensive reading, the form of the manuscripts themselves encouraged their readers to treat them as allegorical, even literal, shields. 
	In order to evidence this reading practice, this dissertation explores the transmission history, textual content, and cultural contexts of two Middle English verse texts. Part I shows how ‚ÄòO Vernicle,‚Äô a fourteenth century lyric on the arma Christi (the ‚Äòarms of Christ‚Äô), exemplifies the ritualistic nature of defensive reading. Extant in ten rolls and ten codices, the textual presentation encourages the reader to imaginatively arm themselves with the arma Christi, turning those weapons once used against Christ into their ‚Äòarmor of God‚Äô (Eph. 6:11). Part II focuses on the late thirteenth-century collection of sanctorale and temporale entries known as the South English Legendary. It deals predominantly with an early reader of the collection ‚Äì a redactor whose ‚Äòedits‚Äô transformed the historical trajectory of the South English Legendary, imbued it with a defensive purpose, and shaped the way it was recopied through the fourteenth and fifteenth century. The content of both texts, made up of image/text arma Christi units and hagiographic vitae and temporale respectively, divide and compartmentalize the reading experience. This suits the defensive agenda, allowing the reader to collect ‚Äòtextual shields‚Äô as spiritual armor.
	Putting on the Armor of God defines a widespread cultural practice ‚Äì ‚Äòdefensive reading.‚Äô It demonstrates not only that medieval readers consciously read certain devotional Middle English texts in order to defend themselves against spiritual evils, but also that they were copied and redacted with this purpose in mind. Ultimately it shows that, in the later Middle Ages, reading was a way of putting on the ‚Äòarmor of God‚Äô (Eph. 6:11)."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:40:58Z (GMT).

Despite wide applications, predicting non-woven mechanical strength and toughness remains a difficult task. One difficulty is that non-wovens usually experience complex microstructure change at finite strains, which involves a combination of fiber stretching, fiber bending, fiber rotation and bond breakage. Another challenge comes from the lack of effective experimental method to characterize interfiber bond properties. Moreover, the fiber deformation in a non-woven is non-affine, which is different from a classical continuum solid. Modeling microscopic fiber deformation and bond fracture within a continuum mechanics framework is not yet well established. This dissertation contributes to understand non-woven damage mechanics and to model non-woven mechanical behaviors at finite strains. First, we present a series of mechanical tests with in-situ X-ray imaging on three versions of non-woven with different areal weights. Experimental results revealed that (1) the decrease in the number of bonds in low density materials was significant, and drastic damage occurred at a lower strain than in the high density counterparts (2) no significant fiber orientation change was observed before the peak load in high areal weight non-wovens, which suggests that the inter-fiber bonds provide strong constraints on the network structure and limit fiber rotation. Second, we present a novel combined experimental and computational approach to extract bond strength. The method proposed in this work carries the dual advantages of characterizing actual bonds in a non-woven and characterizing hundreds of bonds simultaneously. Third, we present a micromechanics based damage model which is built upon modeling single bond breaking process and linking local damage events to macroscopic behaviors. The model is able to reproduce experimentally observed behaviors include elastic slope, non-linear hardening slope, peak load and damage localization under uniaxial tensile loading as a function of network density. The proposed model bridges non-woven microstructure and macroscopic behaviors and thus can serve as an effective tool for future studies of the mechanics of fiber network materials.		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:46Z (GMT).

However, their adoption by managers is limited by variable field performance, to which variability in abiotic and biotic soil properties is a likely contributor. Abiotic soil properties such as texture, moisture, and porosity can affect the ability of EPNs to survive, move, and locate hosts. Also, many soil organisms can interact with EPNs in helpful or harmful ways, though their effects on EPN infectivity remain poorly quantified. Increased knowledge of the extent and relevance of abiotic and biotic soil properties‚Äô effects on EPN performance will help managers better utilize EPNs against pests, both through increased ability to predict whether or not EPNs will be effective in a given soil and through soil management practices to increase their suitability for EPNs. My research is focused on examining the effects of biotic interactions on the ability of EPNs to infect hosts, and also to relate biotic and abiotic soil properties to EPN control of a pest insect in field soils. 	In laboratory trials, I evaluated the effect of soil microarthropod communities on EPN infectivity against the model host Galleria mellonella. Individuals of the EPN Heterorhabditis bacteriophora were applied into loam soil mesocosms containing or lacking a microarthropod community. Five G. mellonella larvae were introduced to each mesocosm sixteen days later and removed after an additional five days. The cadavers were dissected and average number of invading EPNs determined for each replicate, as well as the overall percentage of infection. Percent EPN infection of G. mellonella and average EPN establishment was significantly lower in soils with fauna than in soils without fauna. In addition, linear regression analysis suggested a significant negative correlation between the abundance of predatory mesostigmatid mites and EPN establishment within hosts. These results indicate negative effects of soil animals on EPN infectivity, likely due to predation. 	In the field, the relationship between EPN efficacy and biotic as well as abiotic soil properties was tested in turfgrass athletic fields. A series of field bioassays with the EPNs H. bacteriophora and Steinernema feltiae were conducted against the root-feeding turfgrass pest Popillia japonica. Sentinel P. japonica grubs were buried in replicated plots in two school soccer fields, in both the high-traffic areas in front of the goals and the low-traffic areas in the corners of the fields. EPNs were applied to the plots and the EPN infection of the grubs recorded. Additional measurements of abiotic soil properties and the abundances of four microarthropod groups were recorded. EPNs achieved modest control of P. japonica grubs at one of the two sites. Efficacy of S. feltiae was much higher in low-traffic soils than in high-traffic soils at one of the two tested fields in 2016 but not 2017. Sand content was the only soil property tracking EPN efficacy along a non-metric multidimensional scaling matrix, indicating abiotic properties take precedence over biotic properties in determining EPN efficacy in turfgrass field soils.  	While biotic interactions may reduce EPN infectivity under laboratory conditions, in the field setting of turfgrass soccer fields, abiotic soil properties are more important influences of EPN efficacy."

I expanded our knowledge of olfactory communication by testing the following hypotheses: self-grooming is a form of olfactory communication in the dwarf hamster Phodopus sungorus; naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) are capable of social-dominance-based discrimination of odor; and rolling behaviors of naked mole-rats function as a form of scent-marking.
Self-grooming is ubiquitous among mammals, yet our knowledge of the functions of this behavior beyond cleaning the body surface is limited. Dwarf hamsters were exposed to cotton nesting material scented by same-sex and opposite-sex conspecifics, as well as an unscented control. As predicted, subjects self-groomed more in response to conspecific odor than unscented controls, an important first step in demonstrating communication. Furthermore, self-grooming in response to opposite-sex odor was higher than same-sex odor and unscented controls, which did not differ from each other, suggesting that its communicative function is to attract a mate. 
Naked mole-rats live in underground eusocial colonies in which social dominance plays important roles in their reproductive division of labor, cooperation, mate choice, and access to food. Three colonies were tested using a T-choice apparatus in which each stimulus arm contained the whole-body odor of one of two fellow colony members that differed in dominance rank. Subjects were tested with several pairs of stimulus odor donors that varied in dominance status, sex, breeding status, and body weight, and subjects were analyzed separately according to sex, breeding status, absolute dominance rank, and relative dominance rank. The overall results were consistent: naked mole-rats mostly preferred to enter the arm containing dominant odor. 
Naked mole-rats perform rolling behaviors in which an individual‚Äôs dorsum contacts the floor, and these behaviors may function in scent-marking. A plastic tube in each of three test colony tunnel systems was replaced on alternating days with a clean tube, to stimulate scent-marking, or a ‚Äúdirty‚Äù tube that had been part of the colony tunnel system for 24 h prior. For both sexes, rolling behaviors were more frequent in the clean than the dirty stimulus tube condition within 2.75 h of tube replacement."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:46Z (GMT).

In budding yeast, a single actin monomer pool is used to build both actin cables involved in polarized growth and actin cortical patches involved in endocytosis. Here I report how Aim21/Tda2 is recruited to the membrane-proximal region of actin patches, how it negatively regulates actin assembly at patches to elevate the available actin monomer pool, and how an array of actin regulators is orchestrated to ensure proper assembly of both structures.
Aim21 has four polyproline regions and is recruited to actin patches by two SH3-containing patch proteins Bbc1 and Abp1. The C-terminal region, which is required for its function, binds to Tda2. Cell biological and biochemical data reveal that Aim21/Tda2 is a negative regulator of barbed end F-actin assembly and plays a pivotal role in balancing the distribution of actin between cables and patches, demonstrated by the rescue of the growth defect of tpm1Œî cells by aim21Œî. Additionally, this activity is necessary for efficient endocytosis. Aim21/Tda2 forms a complex with the F-actin barbed end capping protein Cap1/Cap2, revealing an interplay between regulators, and illustrating the complexity of regulation of barbed end assembly."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:00Z (GMT).

Maintaining proper membrane architecture and dynamics in this highly compartmentalized organelle is accomplished in part through ATL-mediated fusion of ER tubules to form a highly interconnected reticular system of three-way junctions. Mechanistically, ATL couples the energy from GTP hydrolysis to a series of conformational changes and homodimerization events that result in membrane fusion. Higher eukaryotes express three ATL isoforms. Two of these isoforms, human ATL1 and ATL3 have been implicated in neurological disorders, namely Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) and Hereditary Sensory Neuropathy (HSN) where axon function is impaired. Disease causing mutations in atl1 and atl3 are dominant-negative and cause the exchange of reticular ER for long unbranched membrane tubules. The underlying mechanistic differences between human isoforms and disease-associated mutations are poorly understood.
Here we identify and give order to discrete temporal steps in the catalytic cycle for ATL1 and ATL3. A comparative study demonstrates that isoforms sample the same series of events but do so at different timescales. We also establish a conserved mechanism for the displacement of the catalytic magnesium ion post GTP hydrolysis. Investigation into mechanisms of disease pathogenesis yields structural and functional defects of an atypical HSP variant. This HSP mutant, ATL1-F151S, is impaired in its GTP hydrolysis cycle but is capable of sampling the high affinity homodimer when bound to a transition state analog. These findings along with additional structural information from mutant proteins define a mechanism for allosteric coupling where F151 is the central residue in a hydrophobic interaction network connecting the active-site to an inter-domain interface responsible for nucleotide loading."

International agricultural trade are often affected by policies in importing and exporting countries. These policies can be directly or indirectly imposed on the production inputs. It is important to understand the markets‚Äô responses in both importing and exporting countries to the policies changes through vertical linkages between the input and output markets. This dissertation provides three essays to study this topic from the prospective of importer, exporter, input market, output market, and trade negotiation mechanism. 
 Essay 1 studies a European Union trade policy induced technological innovation, specifically on its impact on the U.S. apple markets. I adopt the Ex Ante approach to simulate the market reaction to both the European Union policy change and the technological innovation. The research finds that the policy induced technological innovation benefits the outputs that are intensive in the policy affected input. The methodology and conclusion contribute to research on markets with highly differentiated products.
Essay 2 is motivated by the decade-long cotton dispute between Brazil and the United States. The dispute was arbitrated based on several domestic policies of the United States. This chapter analyzes the impact of a U.S. domestic policy on 1) land re-allocation with a difference-in difference model; 2) international cotton trade between the United States and the rest of world including Brazil with a partial equilibrium simulation model. Based on the analysis, I find limited policy impact of removing this particularly U.S. domestic policy on international cotton trade. The result is consistent to the World Trade Organization arbitration of the dispute. 
Essay 3 summarizes three most common methods of quantifying the trade impact of non-tariff trade measures in the literature. I carefully compare the advantages and disadvantages between each method. A guidance of how to choose an appropriate method based on the characteristic of a non-tariff trade measure is summarized. To illustrate the guidance, I show a real example of apple trade with non-tariff trade measure imposed by the European Union."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:01Z (GMT).

We study the effect of an individual's peers on his occupational preferences among cadets at West Point. We exploit unique institutional details at West Point, including random assignment of cadets to peer groups and the repeated elicitation of occupational preferences to overcome common biases that arise in the study of peer effects. Overall, we find little evidence of peer effects in this setting.

This paper uses restricted-access Survey of Earned Doctorates merged with other datasets to study which attributes of a doctoral university are associated with a higher share of its undergraduate BAs who proceed to earn a PhD. We consider four fields: humanities, physical sciences, life sciences, and social sciences. We use truncation correction methodology to correct for PhDs earned after the data end. In our main specification, we find that across all fields PhD production is positively related to student test scores and the number of high-quality PhD programs an institution has. It is negatively related to the total number of students and the share of total BAs that are received in the field.  The third essay is entitled "Information and the Beauty Premium in Political Elections." It is coauthored with Joseph Price. We study the beauty premium in U.S. political elections. We collect subjective beauty data on candidate photos from participants on an internet survey. We find that more beautiful candidates receive a higher vote share and are more likely to win, but that this is moderated by situations in which the voter is more likely to have less information on the candidate. The beauty premium is smaller‚Äîor zero‚Äîfor U.S. congressional races than for state congressional races. It is also smaller for incumbents and in elections in which there is more campaign spending.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:47Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 2

I expanded our knowledge of olfactory communication by testing the following hypotheses: self-grooming is a form of olfactory communication in the dwarf hamster Phodopus sungorus; naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) are capable of social-dominance-based discrimination of odor; and rolling behaviors of naked mole-rats function as a form of scent-marking.
Self-grooming is ubiquitous among mammals, yet our knowledge of the functions of this behavior beyond cleaning the body surface is limited. Dwarf hamsters were exposed to cotton nesting material scented by same-sex and opposite-sex conspecifics, as well as an unscented control. As predicted, subjects self-groomed more in response to conspecific odor than unscented controls, an important first step in demonstrating communication. Furthermore, self-grooming in response to opposite-sex odor was higher than same-sex odor and unscented controls, which did not differ from each other, suggesting that its communicative function is to attract a mate. 
Naked mole-rats live in underground eusocial colonies in which social dominance plays important roles in their reproductive division of labor, cooperation, mate choice, and access to food. Three colonies were tested using a T-choice apparatus in which each stimulus arm contained the whole-body odor of one of two fellow colony members that differed in dominance rank. Subjects were tested with several pairs of stimulus odor donors that varied in dominance status, sex, breeding status, and body weight, and subjects were analyzed separately according to sex, breeding status, absolute dominance rank, and relative dominance rank. The overall results were consistent: naked mole-rats mostly preferred to enter the arm containing dominant odor. 
Naked mole-rats perform rolling behaviors in which an individual‚Äôs dorsum contacts the floor, and these behaviors may function in scent-marking. A plastic tube in each of three test colony tunnel systems was replaced on alternating days with a clean tube, to stimulate scent-marking, or a ‚Äúdirty‚Äù tube that had been part of the colony tunnel system for 24 h prior. For both sexes, rolling behaviors were more frequent in the clean than the dirty stimulus tube condition within 2.75 h of tube replacement."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:03Z (GMT).

Thousands are known, with dozens of new ones being discovered every week. Yet the physical characterization of near-Earth asteroids lags well behind discovery. Studying some asteroids in detail helps to reveal the properties of the overall population. This work focuses on the detailed characterization of a few specific near-Earth asteroids with high-quality data sets, particularly radar observations that can be used to determine their shapes and rotation states. Incorporating multiple types of observational data enables much better characterization than could be done with any single data set.
Chapter 2: For (162421) 2000 ET70, incorporating lightcurves that had not been used for the modeling of Naidu et al. (2013) allows a better determination of its dimensions and rotation state. Incorporating infrared spectra further refines ET70's rotation state, since thermal modeling shows that some pole directions that provide good fits to the radar and lightcurve data are not compatible with the infrared observations. Thermal modeling also indicates that ET70's surface is heterogeneous, since no thermal model with uniform surface properties could provide an adequate fit to all of the infrared spectra.
Chapter 3: (85989) 1999 JD6 was observed to have a large amplitude in visible and infrared lightcurves, suggesting that it is a highly elongated body. Radar images obtained during JD6's close approach in 2015 confirm this, revealing a contact binary with a maximum breadth of 3.0 km. Due to fortuitous observing geometry during some of the radar observations, its rotation state can be determined to great accuracy. The direction of JD6's rotation axis is known more accurately than that of any other asteroid for which only Earth-based observations are available.
Chapter 4: One promising way to speed up part of the asteroid shape modeling process is by using Bayesian optimization to test pole directions autonomously. This requires less computational time and less human oversight than a traditional grid search."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:02Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, x-ray detector capabilities must advance in concert with light source technology to fully realize experimental possibilities. X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) place particularly large demands on the capabilities of detectors, and
developments towards diffraction-limited storage ring sources also necessitate detectors capable of measuring very high flux [1‚Äì3]. The detector described herein builds on the Mixed Mode Pixel Array Detector (MM-PAD) framework, developed previously by our group to perform high dynamic range imaging, and the Adaptive Gain Integrating Pixel Detector (AGIPD) developed for the European XFEL by a collaboration between Deustsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), the Paul-Scherrer-Institute (PSI), the University of Hamburg, and the University of Bonn, led by Heinz Graafsma [4, 5]. The feasibility of combining adaptive gain with charge removal techniques to increase dynamic range in XFEL experiments is assessed by simulating XFEL scatter with a pulsed infrared laser. The strategy is incorporated into pixel prototypes which are evaluated with direct current injection to simulate very high incident x-ray flux. 
A fully functional 16x16 pixel hybrid integrating x-ray detector featuring several different pixel architectures based on the prototypes was developed. This dissertation describes its operation and characterization. To extend dynamic range, charge is removed from the integration node of the front-end amplifier without interrupting integration. The number of times this process occurs is recorded by a digital counter in the pixel. The parameter limiting full well is thereby shifted from the size of an integration capacitor to the depth of a digital counter. The result is similar to that achieved by counting pixel array detectors, but the integrators presented here are designed to tolerate a sustained flux >10^11 x-rays/pixel/second. In addition, digitization of residual analog signals allows sensitivity for single x-rays or low flux signals. Pixel high flux linearity is evaluated by direct exposure to an unattenuated synchrotron source x-ray beam and flux measurements of more than 10^10 9.52 keV x-rays/pixel/s are made. Detector sensitivity to small signals is evaluated and dominant sources of error are identified. These new pixels boast multiple orders of magnitude improvement in maximum sustained flux over the MM-PAD, which is capable of measuring a sustained flux in excess of 10^8 x-rays/pixel/second while maintaining sensitivity to smaller signals, down to single x-rays."

Mostly forgotten today, this repertoire played an important role in the development of media technologies that lead to the emergence of film at the end of the century. The devil operated as a figure who both generated and critiqued theatrical spectacle. This dissertation examines these musical stage works in the context of their literary origins and considers how the medium of the stage offered new representational possibilities. By exploring adaptations of Goethe‚Äôs Faust, Cazotte‚Äôs Le diable amoureux, and the story of Robert le diable, this project not only sheds light on the technologies that made them stageable, but also demonstrates the potential for methodologies aligned with the digital humanities to elucidate this repertoire further.

American President Richard Nixon and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger funneled vast sums of U.S. military and economic aid to island Southeast Asia via the anticommunist policy of the Nixon Doctrine. Facing no meaningful communist threats, national leaders in the region then used American largesse to construct and consolidate newly authoritarian regimes. Indonesia played a leading role in this process, disseminating its authoritarian state-building doctrine of national resilience and encouraging a ‚ÄúNew Orderization‚Äù of island Southeast Asia. The transformation of the region‚Äôs political systems then reverberated on both sides of the Pacific. In the United States, diasporic communities and human rights groups lobbied against the provision of American aid to authoritarian regimes and contributed to a broad left-right coalition that undermined the Nixon and Ford administration‚Äôs core foreign policy projects. In island Southeast Asia, the narrowing of legitimate channels of political contestation produced an efflorescence of disloyal opposition movements, including communist, Islamist, and separatist insurgencies. The narrative emphasizes several themes, including the international and transnational construction of authoritarian rule, the importance of regional history, and the agency of American and Southeast Asian leaders and publics.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:48Z (GMT).

These abilities make them formidable enemies in food and agricultural environments. Considering these fungi as a continuum in both environments offers a novel way to examine problems that can arise in the field and end on the shelf. Challenging long-held notions about where spoilage fungi can originate, sea salts were examined as potential sources of low water activity spoilage fungi and were found to contain spoilage-species of Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Cladosporium. Exploring another group of extreme fungi, the farm-to-food transmission route of the heat-resistant spoilage mold, Paecilomyces niveus (Byssochlamys nivea) was elucidated. It was found in a third of New York orchard soils sampled. Experimental inoculations demonstrated its ability to cause a postharvest disease of apples in accordance with Koch‚Äôs postulates. The disease was later demonstrated on developing fruit in apple orchards. The newly described disease, Paecilomyces rot, caused by P. niveus presents with symptoms including circular, concentrically-ringed, brown lesions. Its firm, U-shaped internal rot resembles other fungal apple diseases. Importantly, Paecilomyces niveus was observed to produce its heat-resistant ascospores inside apples. When infected apples were used to make juice concentrate using common industry protocols, with stringent thermal processing, some ascospores survived in the finished product. The results suggest that when lesser-quality apples, infected with P. niveus, are used to make concentrate they may introduce spoilage inoculum as well as patulin, the most significant apple mycotoxin. To evaluate control methods for this new disease in the field, the efficacy of EC50 concentrations of difenoconazole, fludioxonil, and pyrimethanil, three active ingredients in fungicides, were tested on thirty P. niveus isolates. Cultures from agricultural environments, likely to have been previously exposed to fungicides, were found to be less sensitive than cultures from environments, such as food, where prior exposure was unlikely. Although resistance does not appear to be widespread, the exposed isolates were significantly less sensitive to fludioxonil. Future research should explore the spoilage implications of this apple disease, its incidence and etiology, and its control before and after harvest.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:48Z (GMT).

Service providers now have fewer total opportunities to interact with guests, and when they do, the nature of the interaction is more likely to be difficult and conflict-oriented. This research examines the role of intrinsic employee behaviors or the ‚Äúhow‚Äù in the delivery of service. Specifically, this study examines the influence of Employee Engagement, Communication, and Attitude on guest perception. First finding that these behaviors are significant in impacting the guest‚Äôs perception of their experience, this research then examines the ability to improve these specific employee behaviors through technology-supported training interventions. The results show that, in a hospitality context, technology-support training interventions are only successful at changing employee behaviors when delivered via a blended learning modality; moreover, guests who experience a problem during service delivery have the largest opportunity for improved interactions with service personnel.		6/8/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:49Z (GMT).

Meaning-based, gist memory, unlike detailed, verbatim memory, is more resistant to fading over time, but this resilient type of memory can also facilitate the production of false memories.  This is especially true when the items to be remembered are connected via semantic relationships, as in stereotypes, and reliance on gist memories, increases with age.  We first provide an overview of FTT and the false memory phenomenon.  We then present results from 2 experiments using a cued recall task tapping self-generated stereotypes for eating habits of two hypothetical people (a healthy eater and an unhealthy eater) based on the frequency of their meals.  In the first experiment, we used a between-subjects manipulation of delay (either immediately tested or after 7 days) and recruited 2 age groups (18-22 or older than 55).  770 college-age and 92 older adults in the U.S. were shown 20 meals that two hypothetical people ate in the past month.  We then tested participants on how many times a certain meal repeated among the 20 they studied.  Probes included targets, gist-consistent distractors and gist-inconsistent distractors.  This design allowed us to gather data on how false memories for self-generated stereotypes compared to true memories for each age group and how that changed with or without a delay.  In our second study, we again examined the effects of delay and age with a sample of 117 college-aged (18-22) and 133 post college (23-55) participants from Brazil.  Last, we ran a planned comparison of the 770 participants in the 18-22 group from the U.S. and the 133 participants from the 18-22 group from Brazil for another 2 (country) x 2 (immediate or delay) between-subjects design.  In our experiments, results supported FTT‚Äôs predictions: Related distractors that fit the stereotype were falsely remembered to have appeared as often as targets that were shown.  This effect grew stronger with age and after a delay, such that our oldest age group, over 55 years of age, estimated stereotype-consistent distractors as having been presented multiple times and, in some cases, more often than the true targets.  Our results show that self-generated stereotypes not only facilitate false memory production, but that this effect is reliable across cultures and is strengthened as one ages and with a delay between presentation and testing.  These results are particularly important in a legal context, where memory is rarely tested immediately after important events and accurate memory can determine if a defendant is convicted.

Specifically, an electrically heated hydrothermal jet was impinged on the surface of cylindrical Barre Granite samples (basement rock) contained in an autoclave reactor to induce thermal spallation. Comminution of the rock surfaces was achieved at supercritical water conditions, temperatures from 535- 580¬∞C and pressures of 22.5-27MPa. These conditions simulate those encountered in drilling deep, water-filled wells. Preferential removal of quartz grains from the rock matrix was observed. However, experimentally determined heat flux and surface temperature measurements indicated that hydrothermal comminution occurred below the empirically determined minimums for the onset of continuous thermal spallation for low-density flame jet drilling. Chemically enhanced hydrothermal spallation drilling experiments introduced sodium hydroxide into the hydrothermal jet, at the same supercritical conditions. The combination of accelerated mineral dissolution due to the presence of hydroxide ions, high temperature kinetics, and thermal stress induced significant rates of rock removal. Comparison with empirical quartz dissolution data indicated this drilling success was primarily due to chemical dissolution, enabling the quantitative modeling of an effective drilling rate.		6/8/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:49Z (GMT).

Chemical kinetics models rely on a network of chemical reactions and a set of physical conditions in which atomic and molecular species are allowed to form and react. We replace the canonical single grain-size in our chemical model MAGICKAL with a grain size distribution and analyze the effects on the chemical composition of the gas and grain surface in quiescent and collapsing dark cloud models. We find that a grain size distribution coupled with a temperature distribution across grain sizes can significantly affect the bulk ice composition when dust temperatures fall near critical values related to the surface binding energies of common interstellar chemical species.
We then apply the updated model to a study of ice formation in the cold envelopes surrounding massive young stellar objects in the Magellanic Clouds. The Magellanic Clouds are local satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, and they provide nearby environments to study star formation at low metallicity. We expand the model calculation of dust temperature to include a treatment for increased interstellar radiation field intensity; we vary the radiation field to model the elevated dust temperatures observed in the Magellanic Clouds. We also adjust the initial elemental abundances used in the model, guided by observations of Magellanic Cloud HII regions. We are able to reproduce the relative ice fractions observed, indicating that metal depletion and elevated grain temperature are important drivers of the envelope ice composition. The observed shortfall in CO in Small Magellanic Cloud sources can be explained by a combination of reduced carbon abundance and increased grain temperatures. The models indicate that a large variation in radiation field strength is required to match the range of observed LMC abundances. CH$_3$OH abundance is found to be enhanced (relative to total carbon abundance) in low-metallicity models, providing seed material for complex organic molecule formation.
We conclude with a preliminary study of the recently discovered hot core in the Large Magellanic Cloud; we create a grid of models to simulate hot core formation in Magellanic Cloud environments, comparing them to models and observations of well-characterized galactic counterparts."

Pairing enantiomeric series afford matched and mismatched stereoselectivities. The structures of mixed tetramers showing 2:2 and 3:1 (alkoxide-rich) stoichiometries are determined spectroscopically. Rate and computational studies provide a viable mechanistic and stereochemical model based on direct reaction of the 3:1 mixed tetramers and unanswered questions for the 2:2 mixed aggregates.

Maintaining proper membrane architecture and dynamics in this highly compartmentalized organelle is accomplished in part through ATL-mediated fusion of ER tubules to form a highly interconnected reticular system of three-way junctions. Mechanistically, ATL couples the energy from GTP hydrolysis to a series of conformational changes and homodimerization events that result in membrane fusion. Higher eukaryotes express three ATL isoforms. Two of these isoforms, human ATL1 and ATL3 have been implicated in neurological disorders, namely Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) and Hereditary Sensory Neuropathy (HSN) where axon function is impaired. Disease causing mutations in atl1 and atl3 are dominant-negative and cause the exchange of reticular ER for long unbranched membrane tubules. The underlying mechanistic differences between human isoforms and disease-associated mutations are poorly understood.
Here we identify and give order to discrete temporal steps in the catalytic cycle for ATL1 and ATL3. A comparative study demonstrates that isoforms sample the same series of events but do so at different timescales. We also establish a conserved mechanism for the displacement of the catalytic magnesium ion post GTP hydrolysis. Investigation into mechanisms of disease pathogenesis yields structural and functional defects of an atypical HSP variant. This HSP mutant, ATL1-F151S, is impaired in its GTP hydrolysis cycle but is capable of sampling the high affinity homodimer when bound to a transition state analog. These findings along with additional structural information from mutant proteins define a mechanism for allosteric coupling where F151 is the central residue in a hydrophobic interaction network connecting the active-site to an inter-domain interface responsible for nucleotide loading."

Many internal physiological processes in our body produce subtle vibrations with different frequencies, which carry representative information about the state of our health. Similarly, characteristics of externally induced vibrations in our surrounding material environment can be indicative of whether any materials or chemicals can pose threats to our health. In my research, I exploit acoustic waves, electromagnetic waves, and their interactions to develop mobile systems that passively and unobtrusively listen to underlying health signals. Despite the rapid growth of mobile health applications in recent years, many of these health sensing modalities remain largely untapped.
In this dissertation, I will present my recent and ongoing research to demonstrate how naturally generated and backscattered acoustic and electromagnetic waves from the human body (e.g., heart, lung, skin) and its surrounding material environment (e.g., food) can be used to infer intermediate health signals like physiological acoustics, vital signs, and spectral properties of materials. I will also describe how these signals can be mapped to high-level health and behavioral variables including non-speech body sound, sleep stages, and food quality. Finally, I will lay out my future plans to develop low-cost next-generation mobile health systems for individualized and community-wide healthcare."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:50Z (GMT).

Households are not isolated; they are connected via a network through various cooperative, sharing, and gift exchange behaviors. In the absence of well-functioning formal institutions, such social networks often serve as the informal contracts. This paper develops a model of risk sharing in the wake of an earthquake, and examined the determinants of the self-enforcing conditions. Based on the theoretical result, we further provide empirical evidence of the labor sharing behavior of 1420 rural household before and after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. We found that the households exposed to higher intensity of earthquakes significantly reduced their effort in investing in and maintaining the labor sharing network. We further examined gift-exchange, another important social interactions that links various households in rural China as a robustness check. We found that people significantly reduce their gift giving behavior in the aftermath of the disaster: one degree increase in earthquake intensity is associated a reduction in gift frequency for one 0.85 to 1 times per year in 2009, and 0.26-0.41 times per year in 2011, respectively. The potential channel is that the unexpected natural disaster introduced a shift in time discount factor, and people were "living like there's no tomorrow" (\cite{filipski2015living}), reduced the reliance on informal social networks, and cut down social investment for the future. While other channels proposed in the model, such as income, income correlation coefficient, risk aversion rate, and network size are not significant.		12/20/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:50Z (GMT).

These foams allow for simple fabrication of complex shapes containing an embedded fluidic network, without the requirement of laborious molding or assembly necessary for other common fabrication methods.       In the first part of this work, a method is described to produce porous silicone via a lost salt process that allows porosity to be easily tuned. This process also allows the silicone to be molded into a variety of geometries, while retaining an interconnected porous network. Porosity is shown to affect foam mechanical properties and actuator performance. Additionally, the flow rate of air through foam samples is characterized with flow studies and X-ray computed tomography, then compared to a theoretical model. To demonstrate the unique geometries possible with this material system, a heart-inspired, compliant water pump is presented that provides pulsatile flow at physiologically relevant frequencies and pressures.      Next, a buckled polyurethane foam system is described. Actuator characterization reveals that a moderate amount of residual compressive strain augments the applied force or the maximum stroke compared with uncompressed actuators. These actuators are applied in a patient-specific direct cardiac compression (DCC) device design. The compliant DCC device is demonstrated on a porcine heart and is capable of assisting heart pumping at systolic and diastolic durations and physiological stroke volumes.      Finally, a compliant haptic interface is developed for virtual reality interactions. The interface is demonstrated in the form of an internally porous controller handle that can change stiffness and shape when pressurized, simulating the physical shape and feel of different virtual objects. The elastomeric handle is composed of an internal lattice network which was selected from an array of geometries with corresponding finite element simulations that compare their buckling. As an additional method of interaction, compressions of the handle are demonstrated as a means of user input.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:50Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Unlike prior work in coding theory which seeks to optimize only the worst-case performance of the code, in this work, codes are designed to enable the decoder to reproduce the source subject to a certain distortion constraint when there are no packets errors, subject to a less stringent distortion constraint when there is one error, etc. The topic of this thesis is to find the trade-off between rate and distortion in such communication scenarios.
A code design based on the Polytope codes is introduced for the binary source with erasure distortion measure and is also proven to have partial optimality property. Moreover, for the point-to-point scenario (N=1 and T=1), both inner bounds and outer bounds are derived for discrete sources with finite alphabet with general distortion measure. For the binary source with Hamming distortion, these two bounds are proven to be the same.
For a Gaussian source with a mean-square error distortion, it is shown that a natural design based on MDS codes is not order-optimal in the rate as the distortion constraint tends to zero, but a hybrid scheme that involves a form of uncoded transmission is. We derive an outer bound which has a constant gap with the inner bound naturally generated by the codes we design, thus fully characterizing the Rate-Distortion region."

However, x-ray detector capabilities must advance in concert with light source technology to fully realize experimental possibilities. X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) place particularly large demands on the capabilities of detectors, and
developments towards diffraction-limited storage ring sources also necessitate detectors capable of measuring very high flux [1‚Äì3]. The detector described herein builds on the Mixed Mode Pixel Array Detector (MM-PAD) framework, developed previously by our group to perform high dynamic range imaging, and the Adaptive Gain Integrating Pixel Detector (AGIPD) developed for the European XFEL by a collaboration between Deustsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), the Paul-Scherrer-Institute (PSI), the University of Hamburg, and the University of Bonn, led by Heinz Graafsma [4, 5]. The feasibility of combining adaptive gain with charge removal techniques to increase dynamic range in XFEL experiments is assessed by simulating XFEL scatter with a pulsed infrared laser. The strategy is incorporated into pixel prototypes which are evaluated with direct current injection to simulate very high incident x-ray flux. 
A fully functional 16x16 pixel hybrid integrating x-ray detector featuring several different pixel architectures based on the prototypes was developed. This dissertation describes its operation and characterization. To extend dynamic range, charge is removed from the integration node of the front-end amplifier without interrupting integration. The number of times this process occurs is recorded by a digital counter in the pixel. The parameter limiting full well is thereby shifted from the size of an integration capacitor to the depth of a digital counter. The result is similar to that achieved by counting pixel array detectors, but the integrators presented here are designed to tolerate a sustained flux >10^11 x-rays/pixel/second. In addition, digitization of residual analog signals allows sensitivity for single x-rays or low flux signals. Pixel high flux linearity is evaluated by direct exposure to an unattenuated synchrotron source x-ray beam and flux measurements of more than 10^10 9.52 keV x-rays/pixel/s are made. Detector sensitivity to small signals is evaluated and dominant sources of error are identified. These new pixels boast multiple orders of magnitude improvement in maximum sustained flux over the MM-PAD, which is capable of measuring a sustained flux in excess of 10^8 x-rays/pixel/second while maintaining sensitivity to smaller signals, down to single x-rays."

Mostly forgotten today, this repertoire played an important role in the development of media technologies that lead to the emergence of film at the end of the century. The devil operated as a figure who both generated and critiqued theatrical spectacle. This dissertation examines these musical stage works in the context of their literary origins and considers how the medium of the stage offered new representational possibilities. By exploring adaptations of Goethe‚Äôs Faust, Cazotte‚Äôs Le diable amoureux, and the story of Robert le diable, this project not only sheds light on the technologies that made them stageable, but also demonstrates the potential for methodologies aligned with the digital humanities to elucidate this repertoire further.

Meaning-based, gist memory, unlike detailed, verbatim memory, is more resistant to fading over time, but this resilient type of memory can also facilitate the production of false memories.  This is especially true when the items to be remembered are connected via semantic relationships, as in stereotypes, and reliance on gist memories, increases with age.  We first provide an overview of FTT and the false memory phenomenon.  We then present results from 2 experiments using a cued recall task tapping self-generated stereotypes for eating habits of two hypothetical people (a healthy eater and an unhealthy eater) based on the frequency of their meals.  In the first experiment, we used a between-subjects manipulation of delay (either immediately tested or after 7 days) and recruited 2 age groups (18-22 or older than 55).  770 college-age and 92 older adults in the U.S. were shown 20 meals that two hypothetical people ate in the past month.  We then tested participants on how many times a certain meal repeated among the 20 they studied.  Probes included targets, gist-consistent distractors and gist-inconsistent distractors.  This design allowed us to gather data on how false memories for self-generated stereotypes compared to true memories for each age group and how that changed with or without a delay.  In our second study, we again examined the effects of delay and age with a sample of 117 college-aged (18-22) and 133 post college (23-55) participants from Brazil.  Last, we ran a planned comparison of the 770 participants in the 18-22 group from the U.S. and the 133 participants from the 18-22 group from Brazil for another 2 (country) x 2 (immediate or delay) between-subjects design.  In our experiments, results supported FTT‚Äôs predictions: Related distractors that fit the stereotype were falsely remembered to have appeared as often as targets that were shown.  This effect grew stronger with age and after a delay, such that our oldest age group, over 55 years of age, estimated stereotype-consistent distractors as having been presented multiple times and, in some cases, more often than the true targets.  Our results show that self-generated stereotypes not only facilitate false memory production, but that this effect is reliable across cultures and is strengthened as one ages and with a delay between presentation and testing.  These results are particularly important in a legal context, where memory is rarely tested immediately after important events and accurate memory can determine if a defendant is convicted.

While CD4-positive lymphocytes are accepted as bona fide reservoirs, the contribution of other HIV-susceptible cell types to viral persistence remains unknown. ART therapy is a lifelong commitment for those with HIV, as treatment interruption induces swift rebound of peripheral viremia and progression toward AIDS. This demonstrates that persistent HIV reservoir cells are not eliminated by the virus or cleared by the immune system. However, while the memory T-cell HIV reservoir was discovered twenty years ago, strategies to specifically target these cells for destruction remain elusive. Furthermore, we know far less about HIV- susceptible cells within tissues than those in the blood, including subsets of myeloid cells such as tissue macrophages. Indeed, challenges in the study and isolation of tissue macrophages and the sheer number of organ-specific myeloid subsets has complicated unified efforts to learn whether these cells harbor HIV during treatment. Here I present a series of experimental platforms for the study of HIV tissue reservoirs, with a focus on pulmonary alveolar macrophages of the human lung. To learn whether these cells are HIV-infected in vivo, I describe a flow-cytometry assay using fluorescence RNA in situ hybridization (FISH) that reveals individual HIV- infected primary cells in a cell suspension. These assays are amenable to multiplex HIV antigen staining and sorting of HIV-expressing cells for RNAseq analyses. Using this FISH:FLOW tool I demonstrate a universal caveat in the industry standard cell line 8E5, used routinely as a calibration standard for clinical measurements of the HIV reservoir. Secondly, I engineered several reporter cell platforms for the outgrowth of HIV from tissue reservoirs, and use these tools to develop novel paradigms in the study of HIV replication and cellular transmission in myeloid cells. Finally, I deploy some of these cell lines in a combined HIV outgrowth pipeline to capture and characterize Clade C HIV in the blood and lungs of adults in Blantyre, Malawi. Together, these contributions will accelerate our progress toward therapies that specifically target HIV reservoir cells in the tissues, the key obstacle to an HIV cure.		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:51Z (GMT).

Many early efforts to protect biodiversity at forest frontiers focused on meeting demands for wildlife and biodiversity conservation to the exclusion of the other goods and services demanded of landscapes. The widespread failure of these single sector approaches has led to a renaissance of integrated management approaches in forest landscapes. This thesis explores one such approach, integrated landscape management (ILM), through the lens of the Model Forest Network. In particular, I use a case study approach to assess the roles that landscape initiatives play in their landscapes, the social, political and historical contexts in which they emerge, and how their activities influence stakeholders‚Äô ability to adapt to change. I find that while landscape initiatives are successful in establishing new partnerships and engaging a diversity of stakeholders, they are limited in on-the-ground outcomes and the degree to which they can affect systemic change.

Treating many-body systems with exact quantum dynamics is typically intractable due to the exponential scaling of quantum mechanics.  It is therefore of theoretical interest to develop accurate approximate quantum dynamics methods that are able to capture the mechanisms and varying time scales of many-body systems, while retaining the favorable linear scaling of classical methods.  The focus of this dissertation is the development and application of an approximate quantum dynamics method towards elucidating mechanisms in the condensed phase.  The approximate quantum dynamic method of interest is based on the path integral representation of the quantum Boltzmann distribution ~\cite{DCPW1981}. The quantum Boltzmann distribution describes the classical distribution of a "ring polymer" in an extended phase space. Mapping Variable RPMD (MV-RPMD) is an extension of RPMD that allows for the classical treatment of electronic state transitions by mapping discrete states to continuous phase-space variables and it employs classical trajectories to calculate real-time thermal correlation functions ~\cite{NA2013}. We study the condensed phase reaction dynamics of a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) system and an electron transfer (ET) system using MV-RPMD. We derive a more numerically stable quantum Boltzmann distribution in the MV-RPMD framework by invoking the symmetric Trotter approximation. We construct a four-state electron-proton system from a model PCET system bath model comprised of a proton double well coupled to two discrete electronic states. We establish bead convergence with significantly fewer beads than required in the original system. Further, in studying the mechanism of PCET we show that population dynamics generated from MV-RPMD trajectories can be used to accurately distinguish concerted and sequential PCET mechanisms. We verify the accuracy of PCET mechanisms predicted by MV-RPMD population dynamics by comparing against Fermi's Golden Rule and Kramers rate calculations.  It is known that RPMD is an approximation to the "ImF" version of semiclassical instanton theory when used to calculate reaction rates in the deep tunneling regime ~\cite{SCA2009}. This speaks to RPMD's accuracy in approximating reaction rates within this regime. In an effort to develop a nonadiabatic rate theory in the MV-RPMD framework, we apply the method towards the calculation of an MV-RPMD instanton configuration in a model two-state system ~\cite{CAO1995} and provide preliminary results. Knowledge of the MV-RPMD instanton can provide transition state information necessary for a nonadiabatic rate calculation. In this vein, following our instanton configuration calculations, we develop three new rate expressions, in terms of flux-side thermal correlation functions(TCF), in the MV-RPMD framework .

Chemical kinetics models rely on a network of chemical reactions and a set of physical conditions in which atomic and molecular species are allowed to form and react. We replace the canonical single grain-size in our chemical model MAGICKAL with a grain size distribution and analyze the effects on the chemical composition of the gas and grain surface in quiescent and collapsing dark cloud models. We find that a grain size distribution coupled with a temperature distribution across grain sizes can significantly affect the bulk ice composition when dust temperatures fall near critical values related to the surface binding energies of common interstellar chemical species.
We then apply the updated model to a study of ice formation in the cold envelopes surrounding massive young stellar objects in the Magellanic Clouds. The Magellanic Clouds are local satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, and they provide nearby environments to study star formation at low metallicity. We expand the model calculation of dust temperature to include a treatment for increased interstellar radiation field intensity; we vary the radiation field to model the elevated dust temperatures observed in the Magellanic Clouds. We also adjust the initial elemental abundances used in the model, guided by observations of Magellanic Cloud HII regions. We are able to reproduce the relative ice fractions observed, indicating that metal depletion and elevated grain temperature are important drivers of the envelope ice composition. The observed shortfall in CO in Small Magellanic Cloud sources can be explained by a combination of reduced carbon abundance and increased grain temperatures. The models indicate that a large variation in radiation field strength is required to match the range of observed LMC abundances. CH$_3$OH abundance is found to be enhanced (relative to total carbon abundance) in low-metallicity models, providing seed material for complex organic molecule formation.
We conclude with a preliminary study of the recently discovered hot core in the Large Magellanic Cloud; we create a grid of models to simulate hot core formation in Magellanic Cloud environments, comparing them to models and observations of well-characterized galactic counterparts."

From a case study of a dating app that utilizes shared location history, happn, we showed that LBPHD information was meaningful in building interpersonal relationships. Based on these findings, we designed MoveMeant, an application that extends LBPHD from interpersonal to community-level information sharing. A pilot study suggested the potential of MoveMeant to increase local community awareness through dissemination of local knowledge and discovery of third places. We extended the findings from the pilot study to a large-scale field deployment of MoveMeant across three different communities. Using a research through design approach, we interviewed leaders of the communities in which we deployed MoveMeant to gain an understanding of the social structures in which we introduced the technology. Our findings suggest the potential warranting power of LBPHD to strengthen local ties, but also the risk of users interpreting the data to indicate differences within a community, an effect we call surfacing. Our findings offer design implications for community apps. Future work could determine if design might be able to overcome the effects of surfacing.

Specifically, microparticles can be uniquely identified and imaged throughout the field of view for the duration of an experiment, allowing visualization of both the evolution of the sample as a whole and the activities undertaken by each particle during this evolution.  In addition to the high spatial and time resolution of experiments, the ability to control the interparticle interaction in these systems via modification of the particle shape, surface, and the suspending solvent make microparticles an extremely attractive system for modeling the dynamics of crystallization and melting.
In this thesis, I report the results of two experiments using colloidal microparticles, both containing surprising results.  Chapter 4 reports on the first recorded instance of catalysis of crystal layer growth via slight size-mismatching colloidal particles, while Chapter 5 describes the dynamics of a nonintuitive finding whereby a high-density facet of a crystal melts faster than its lower-density counterpart.  Together, these experiments demonstrate the importance of considering statistical dynamics during phase changes as well as highlight the utility that colloidal systems bring to the table for investigating dynamics during phase changes."

These developments can be regarded as essential building blocks in the prediction of structural reliability subject to extreme wind. In this dissertation, we first review the commonly-used probabilistic models in literature and benchmark these models on a test example to illustrate their properties and examine their advantages and disadvantages. It is shown that the approximations based on these existing models on the extreme estimates exhibit large discrepancies. A new probabilistic model is then proposed to overcome this limitation. The model utilized Markov process whose finite dimensional distribution is characterized in terms of copulas. Finally, an efficient and accurate surrogate model is presented as an alternative to the traditional Monte Carlo method to evaluate the structural responses. The responses are approximated by translation processes whose second-moment properties and marginal distribution are obtained from linear random vibration theory and moment equations. The statements in this dissertation are supported by theoretical arguments and numerical examples.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:54Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Many internal physiological processes in our body produce subtle vibrations with different frequencies, which carry representative information about the state of our health. Similarly, characteristics of externally induced vibrations in our surrounding material environment can be indicative of whether any materials or chemicals can pose threats to our health. In my research, I exploit acoustic waves, electromagnetic waves, and their interactions to develop mobile systems that passively and unobtrusively listen to underlying health signals. Despite the rapid growth of mobile health applications in recent years, many of these health sensing modalities remain largely untapped.
In this dissertation, I will present my recent and ongoing research to demonstrate how naturally generated and backscattered acoustic and electromagnetic waves from the human body (e.g., heart, lung, skin) and its surrounding material environment (e.g., food) can be used to infer intermediate health signals like physiological acoustics, vital signs, and spectral properties of materials. I will also describe how these signals can be mapped to high-level health and behavioral variables including non-speech body sound, sleep stages, and food quality. Finally, I will lay out my future plans to develop low-cost next-generation mobile health systems for individualized and community-wide healthcare."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:07Z (GMT).

Households are not isolated; they are connected via a network through various cooperative, sharing, and gift exchange behaviors. In the absence of well-functioning formal institutions, such social networks often serve as the informal contracts. This paper develops a model of risk sharing in the wake of an earthquake, and examined the determinants of the self-enforcing conditions. Based on the theoretical result, we further provide empirical evidence of the labor sharing behavior of 1420 rural household before and after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. We found that the households exposed to higher intensity of earthquakes significantly reduced their effort in investing in and maintaining the labor sharing network. We further examined gift-exchange, another important social interactions that links various households in rural China as a robustness check. We found that people significantly reduce their gift giving behavior in the aftermath of the disaster: one degree increase in earthquake intensity is associated a reduction in gift frequency for one 0.85 to 1 times per year in 2009, and 0.26-0.41 times per year in 2011, respectively. The potential channel is that the unexpected natural disaster introduced a shift in time discount factor, and people were "living like there's no tomorrow" (\cite{filipski2015living}), reduced the reliance on informal social networks, and cut down social investment for the future. While other channels proposed in the model, such as income, income correlation coefficient, risk aversion rate, and network size are not significant.		12/20/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:07Z (GMT).

It is an endowed property whose revenue is dedicated to a specific purpose in perpetuity.  Historically, waqfs were wealthy establishments and provided society with basic services such as health and educational facilities.  The usurpation of waqf properties by Muslim governments in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, led to a decline of the establishment.  In Pakistan, this was done starting in the 1960s and a Department of Auqaf and Religious Affairs was created for each of the four provinces.  This work demonstrates the Punjab Auqaf Department‚Äôs lack of management and inability to care for both society as well as the province‚Äôs cultural heritage.  It proves that under its current administration, waqfs in Punjab no longer qualify as philanthropic foundations.  In order to both protect and preserve existing waqf properties, most of which are historic, the managerial structure of the Auqaf Department must be improved.  Simultaneously, to enable and encourage the creation of new waqfs, the Islamic trust in Pakistan must be modernized.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:54Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Unlike prior work in coding theory which seeks to optimize only the worst-case performance of the code, in this work, codes are designed to enable the decoder to reproduce the source subject to a certain distortion constraint when there are no packets errors, subject to a less stringent distortion constraint when there is one error, etc. The topic of this thesis is to find the trade-off between rate and distortion in such communication scenarios.
A code design based on the Polytope codes is introduced for the binary source with erasure distortion measure and is also proven to have partial optimality property. Moreover, for the point-to-point scenario (N=1 and T=1), both inner bounds and outer bounds are derived for discrete sources with finite alphabet with general distortion measure. For the binary source with Hamming distortion, these two bounds are proven to be the same.
For a Gaussian source with a mean-square error distortion, it is shown that a natural design based on MDS codes is not order-optimal in the rate as the distortion constraint tends to zero, but a hybrid scheme that involves a form of uncoded transmission is. We derive an outer bound which has a constant gap with the inner bound naturally generated by the codes we design, thus fully characterizing the Rate-Distortion region."

Thus far, most research on collaboration has focused on its evolutionary origins, earliest occurrences, and outcomes (e.g. benefits).  In this dissertation, I examine potential mechanistic and developmental causes of young children‚Äôs collaboration in the hope of shining further light on how human collaboration develops and functions.  I do so by conducting a detailed interdisciplinary examination of predictors of young children‚Äôs spontaneous dyadic collaboration.  Chapter 1 provides an outline of how this research aims to contribute to developmental research on human collaboration.  Chapter 2 examines cognitive predictors, Chapter 3 environmental predictors, and Chapter 4 a physiological predictor of collaboration.  Finally, Chapter 5 discusses the significance of the results for future research and important issues on the horizon for researchers to consider.

The results indicate that virtual reality can facilitate heritage preservation through improved visual presentation and interpretation of site content, tourism management, documentation technology, public participation, and cross-cultural communication.  Virtual reality technology challenges traditional preservation norms as it generates an immersive environment that meets the needs of a wider audience, regardless of place and time.  Virtual reality technology enhances the interactive experience between heritage objects and users.  As is the case for all human-computer interactions, virtual reality technology has a cultural component, which requires further research.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:56Z (GMT).

In literary studies, it traces the trajectory of first-person narratives in medical writings and treatises as they move from iterations of self-care to demonstrations of self-fashioning. It also expands our understanding of early modern autobiographical writing beyond the borders of the literary canon by unearthing new archives of the self in medical discourse. In medical humanities, it refreshes the perspective on the establishment of medical authority by foregrounding rhetorical negotiations in rarely explored archives. In gender studies, it showcases women‚Äôs efforts to protect and maintain the uniqueness of fundamental practices such as touching and caring for pain. By paying close attention to a plurality of representations of experience-based medical knowledge, this project demonstrates the co-existence of various ethics of medicine and underlines how emerging male-midwives endeavored to appropriate traditionally female practices in order to rewrite them as male in their dominant discourse on the body.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:55Z (GMT).

From a case study of a dating app that utilizes shared location history, happn, we showed that LBPHD information was meaningful in building interpersonal relationships. Based on these findings, we designed MoveMeant, an application that extends LBPHD from interpersonal to community-level information sharing. A pilot study suggested the potential of MoveMeant to increase local community awareness through dissemination of local knowledge and discovery of third places. We extended the findings from the pilot study to a large-scale field deployment of MoveMeant across three different communities. Using a research through design approach, we interviewed leaders of the communities in which we deployed MoveMeant to gain an understanding of the social structures in which we introduced the technology. Our findings suggest the potential warranting power of LBPHD to strengthen local ties, but also the risk of users interpreting the data to indicate differences within a community, an effect we call surfacing. Our findings offer design implications for community apps. Future work could determine if design might be able to overcome the effects of surfacing.

Specifically, microparticles can be uniquely identified and imaged throughout the field of view for the duration of an experiment, allowing visualization of both the evolution of the sample as a whole and the activities undertaken by each particle during this evolution.  In addition to the high spatial and time resolution of experiments, the ability to control the interparticle interaction in these systems via modification of the particle shape, surface, and the suspending solvent make microparticles an extremely attractive system for modeling the dynamics of crystallization and melting.
In this thesis, I report the results of two experiments using colloidal microparticles, both containing surprising results.  Chapter 4 reports on the first recorded instance of catalysis of crystal layer growth via slight size-mismatching colloidal particles, while Chapter 5 describes the dynamics of a nonintuitive finding whereby a high-density facet of a crystal melts faster than its lower-density counterpart.  Together, these experiments demonstrate the importance of considering statistical dynamics during phase changes as well as highlight the utility that colloidal systems bring to the table for investigating dynamics during phase changes."

They offer robust fault tolerance in exchange for probabilistic guarantees and convergence, and are characterized by elegance and simplicity.
This body of research considers the problem of gossip protocol representation and composition; that is, how to use simple gossip protocols as building blocks to form more complex and powerful compound protocols.
In doing so, we propose a novel formal representation of gossip, and use it to define the essential properties of gossip systems.
We propose composition operators that combine protocols, and show how properties of operands protocols are (or are not) transferred to the resulting compound protocols.
Choice among composition operators leads to trade-offs of performance and independence, while preserving semantics.
The optimization afforded by what we call ""correlated merge"" operator enables constructions that would be quite difficult to implement on their own by opportunistically combining gossip messages from many constituent protocols.
We discuss which practical syntactic features are helpful for gossip system implementation.
A proof-of-concept implementation named MiCA is presented, consisting of Java-language runtime for gossip, a library of gossip primitives, a simulator for rapid development, and visualization and analysis tools that can be used to interpret the results of experiments."

This kind of deformation is associated with soil liquefaction, landslides, fault rupture, tectonic uplift and subsidence and settlement of loose granular soils.  A large part of this thesis involves the earthquake response of pipelines with defects, e.g., cracks and/or leaking joints, rehabilitated with cured-in-place linings (CIPLs). The thesis begins with the description of a series of full-scale static and dynamic axial tension tests to characterize the tensile capacity of CIPL-reinforced pipelines. The CIPL de-bonding is of great importance for the accommodation of tensile deformation. The amount of CIPL de-bonding is a function of the CIPL properties (i.e. stiffness, tensile strength) with respect to the pipe/CIPL interface bond strength, which increases with increasing internal pressure. A one-dimensional finite element model is developed that accounts for the CIPL de-bonding mechanism as a Mode II fracture propagation phenomenon, including the enhanced pipe/CIPL interface strength in the presence of internal pressure. Seismic wave interaction with CIPL-reinforced pipelines subjects them to alternating tension and compression as the waves propagate through the ground.  The combinations of ground velocity amplitude and pulse period that cause lining deformation are evaluated through analytical models of seismic wave/pipeline interaction and finite element simulations. CIPL-strengthened pipeline response to permanent ground deformation was also investigated through large-scale fault rupture experiments and numerical simulations. Fault rupture test results on pipelines with CIPLs are presented and compared with test results on unlined pipelines, to assess the effectiveness of the CIPLs for seismic retrofit. The results of the numerical model developed in this work that accounts for de-bonding between the lining and pipe as Mode II fracture propagation are in good agreement with full-scale fault rupture test results.  The thesis also includes a comprehensive evaluation of ductile iron (DI) pipeline response to earthquake-induced ground deformation through the results of a large-scale testing program, including a fault rupture test on a 150-mm DI pipeline with restrained axial slip joints. Three different types of DI joints are considered in this study: push-on, restrained, and restrained axial slip joints, which are often referred to as hazard-resilient joints. A series of axial tension, axial compression, four-point bending and ground rupture test results conducted on DI jointed pipes are used to identify the limit states associated with DI joint performance. A two-dimensional finite element model accounting for (i) coupled shear/normal forces to the pipeline and (ii) bell resistance to movement, validated against large-scale fault rupture test results, is used for the quantification of the DI pipeline performance under strike-slip faulting conditions over the entire spectrum of pipeline/fault crossing angles. Pipeline performance is shown to be governed by four limit states, including tensile, compressive, and rotational capacity of the joints and local buckling of the pipe. Each limit state is related to a specific range of pipeline/fault crossing angles, which are identified and shown in parallel with the plots of maximum fault offset vs. pipeline/fault intersection angle.		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:55Z (GMT).

The segregation of chromosomes at the first meiotic division is dependent in most organisms on at least one genetic exchange, or crossover event, between chromosome homologs. Homologs that do not receive a crossover frequently undergo nondisjunction at the first meiotic division, yielding aneuploid gametes. Such events have been linked to human disease and infertility.  Recent studies suggest that the Mlh1-Mlh3 complex is an endonuclease that resolves recombination intermediates into crossovers.  Interestingly, this complex also acts as a matchmaker in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) to remove DNA replication errors.  
How does Mlh1-Mlh3 act in two different processes?  I investigated this question by performing a mutational analysis of the baker‚Äôs yeast Mlh3 protein. This resulted in a comprehensive structure-function map that illustrates the effects of 60 new mlh3 alleles on both functions. From this map, I identified domains critical for one function but not the other. Five alleles (mlh3-6, -23, -42, -45, and -54) disrupt the MMR function while crossing over remains at nearly wild-type levels. Based on two-hybrid analysis, two of these five alleles (mlh3-42, and -54) disrupt interaction with Mlh1. This information suggests that the weakened Mlh1-mlh3 heterodimer is stabilized during crossing over by other protein factors. Alternatively, a weak defect in Mlh1-Mlh3 interaction may not be a limiting factor for crossover resolution in meiosis. In addition, I identified one allele (mlh3-32) that disrupted crossing over while maintaining nearly wild-type MMR. Mlh1-mlh3 representatives for each class were purified and characterized. Both Mlh1-mlh3-32 (MMR+, crossover-) and Mlh1-mlh3-45 (MMR-, crossover+) displayed wild-type endonuclease activities in vitro.  Msh2-Msh3, an MSH complex that acts with Mlh1-Mlh3 in MMR, stimulated the endonuclease activity of Mlh1-mlh3-32 but not Mlh1-mlh3-45, suggesting that Mlh1-mlh3-45 is defective in MSH interactions. Based on these and other observations, my work supports the model that protein-protein interactions with MMR or crossover specific factors are critical in regulating Mlh1-Mlh3‚Äôs enzymatic activity. 
Furthermore, I present five mlh3 mutations (mlh3-39, -40, -57, -58, 59) predicted to disrupt metal binding based on Pms1 structure, which conferred defects in both functions, suggesting the essential endonuclease active site in Mlh3 folds in a manner analogous to Pms1. Finally, whole genome recombination maps were constructed for wild-type and MMR+ crossover-, MMR- crossover+, endonuclease defective and null mlh3 mutants in an S288c/YJM789 hybrid background.  Compared to wild-type, all of the mlh3 mutants showed increases in the number of noncrossover events, consistent with recombination intermediates being resolved through alternative recombination pathways. Together, these data illustrate how defective meiotic components can alter the fate of meiotic recombination intermediates, providing new insights into how meiotic recombination pathways are regulated."

The relational composition refers to a venture team‚Äôs internal network. The extent to which the team composition depends on one type of social relations rather than another produces different organizational characteristics and bring important implications for its later outcomes. This research particularly focuses on the distinction between family and non-family affiliations and investigates the formation and evolution of such team composition as an input as well as an output. In the first empirical chapter, I examine the role of entrepreneur‚Äôs gender in the relational composition of venture businesses by focusing both on who creates a team rather than developing a single-owned enterprise, and on who creates a team with family members rather than non-family members. By analyzing venture businesses in the U.S., I find that females are constrained to establishing solo businesses in comparison to males. Also, when they establish an entrepreneurial team, female entrepreneurs tend to utilize family ties rather than work-related ties compared to their male counterpart. The second empirical study examines how the relational composition of venture teams influences its membership change. In this study, I introduce a new typology of venture teams based on the relational composition: family-only teams, non-family teams, and family/non-family mixed teams. Based on this typology, I find that family-only teams have the most stable structure among the three types with the lowest level of team turnover. On the other hand, non-family teams have the most fluidic form with the highest levels of both member withdrawal and recruitment. Founders in mixed teams are more likely to leave their firms due to internal conflicts between different types of members, and this negative nature of mixed teams hinders a future recruitment of co-founders. Lastly, I shift my focus to the performance aspect of these teams in the final empirical study. Using a competing risks event history modeling, I find that family-only teams show the most successful performance propelled by strong cohesion among team members. On the other hand, mixed teams produce the least successful outcomes due to the faultlines between family and non-family members. All in all, the results reveal the strength of family-only entrepreneurial teams in both maintaining a stable structure and producing a favorable performance outcome, while showing the weakness of mixed teams with a fragile team structure and a negative performance outcome.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:58Z (GMT).

These developments can be regarded as essential building blocks in the prediction of structural reliability subject to extreme wind. In this dissertation, we first review the commonly-used probabilistic models in literature and benchmark these models on a test example to illustrate their properties and examine their advantages and disadvantages. It is shown that the approximations based on these existing models on the extreme estimates exhibit large discrepancies. A new probabilistic model is then proposed to overcome this limitation. The model utilized Markov process whose finite dimensional distribution is characterized in terms of copulas. Finally, an efficient and accurate surrogate model is presented as an alternative to the traditional Monte Carlo method to evaluate the structural responses. The responses are approximated by translation processes whose second-moment properties and marginal distribution are obtained from linear random vibration theory and moment equations. The statements in this dissertation are supported by theoretical arguments and numerical examples.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:10Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Tackling these problems
will give more insight into how their users use these online platforms with the hope that the results can be generalized to the offline world. Every major step in human history was accompanied by an innovation, from the time that mankind invented and mastered the production of fire, to the invention of the World Wide Web. The societal process of adopting innovations has been a case that has fascinated many researchers throughout the past century.
 Prior to the existence of online social networks, economists and sociologists were able to study these phenomena on small groups of people through microeconomics and microsociology. However, the data gathered from these online communities help us to take one step further, initiating studies on macroeconomic and macrosociologal problems‚Äîin addition to the previous two areas. Work in this thesis sheds light on the properties of both innovators and laggards, the expansion and adaptation of innovation, competition among innovations with the same purpose, and the eventual crowding out of competitor innovations in the target society. Lastly, we look at the bigger picture by studying the entire diffusion process as a whole, abstracting out a great deal of details.

Kleinberg, Jon M.||Foster, John N.	2018-10-22T17:22:56Z	2018-10-22T17:22:56Z		5/30/18		This dissertation describes techniques to store and process large graphs in modern datacenters with high performance and strong consistency guarantees.  Graph-structured data is ubiquitous: social networks, content networks, cryptocurrency transaction histories, and business analytics routinely store and manipulate large graphs.  For reasons of scale, both in terms of data size as well as workload volume, it is necessary to store such large graphs in a distributed fashion.  Moreover, graph workloads have unique characteristics, such as long running read queries interspersed with shorter updates, that naturally lead to a programming interface consisting of a hybrid of transactions and analytics.  Providing efficient and consistent access to graph-structured data is a significant challenge. This dissertation makes three contributions.  First, it describes a novel technique to order distributed transactions by introducing the concept of an ordering service.  An ordering service seeks to simplify the design of modern distributed systems by factoring out the task of ordering from the core system into a separate service.  Second, it details techniques that scale up the performance of a centralized ordering service by combining it with a lightweight timestamping mechanism.  Third, it describes a full implementation of Weaver, a new distributed, transactional graph store that includes mechanisms for practical and efficient graph data management, such as dynamic resharding of graph partitions and caching of query results.  Overall, these techniques lead to a scalable and consistent graph store that is capable of supporting modern distributed applications with high performance.

Just as St Boniface reportedly held up a scriptural manuscript at his moment of martyrdom to protect himself from the sword, medieval readers saw their books, and the texts contained within them, as spiritual and physical protection against devilish attacks. Not only were texts adapted and manipulated by redactors for defensive reading, the form of the manuscripts themselves encouraged their readers to treat them as allegorical, even literal, shields. 
	In order to evidence this reading practice, this dissertation explores the transmission history, textual content, and cultural contexts of two Middle English verse texts. Part I shows how ‚ÄòO Vernicle,‚Äô a fourteenth century lyric on the arma Christi (the ‚Äòarms of Christ‚Äô), exemplifies the ritualistic nature of defensive reading. Extant in ten rolls and ten codices, the textual presentation encourages the reader to imaginatively arm themselves with the arma Christi, turning those weapons once used against Christ into their ‚Äòarmor of God‚Äô (Eph. 6:11). Part II focuses on the late thirteenth-century collection of sanctorale and temporale entries known as the South English Legendary. It deals predominantly with an early reader of the collection ‚Äì a redactor whose ‚Äòedits‚Äô transformed the historical trajectory of the South English Legendary, imbued it with a defensive purpose, and shaped the way it was recopied through the fourteenth and fifteenth century. The content of both texts, made up of image/text arma Christi units and hagiographic vitae and temporale respectively, divide and compartmentalize the reading experience. This suits the defensive agenda, allowing the reader to collect ‚Äòtextual shields‚Äô as spiritual armor.
	Putting on the Armor of God defines a widespread cultural practice ‚Äì ‚Äòdefensive reading.‚Äô It demonstrates not only that medieval readers consciously read certain devotional Middle English texts in order to defend themselves against spiritual evils, but also that they were copied and redacted with this purpose in mind. Ultimately it shows that, in the later Middle Ages, reading was a way of putting on the ‚Äòarmor of God‚Äô (Eph. 6:11)."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:43Z (GMT).

Mimno, David	2018-10-22T17:22:56Z	2018-10-22T17:22:56Z		5/30/18		In this work, we explore different techniques to extract opinions, sentiments and beliefs from text. In particular, we look at neural network based approaches since deep learning has gained wide popularity nowadays and is known to perform effectively for the kind of problems we are looking at.  The first goal was to solve the BeSt (Belief and Sentiment) Evaluation task from the 2016 Text Analysis Conference. Here we used bidirectional Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs) for sentiment detection in a given document. We looked with particular interest at the sentiment polarity to find out whether it is positive, negative or neutral sentiment. Our neural network based model consists of a multi-layered bidirectional LSTM which takes as input embeddings for the sequence of words in a given sentence along with annotated source and target, and outputs probabilities for the different sentiment polarities. We evaluated the model using standard precision, recall and F1 scores and then compared our results to scores in the existing literature. The second goal was to identify opinion expressions along with their sources and targets in a given text. We compared a simple baseline approach, support vector machine and conditional random field to a feedforward neural network and a bidirectional LSTM approach. All approaches were evaluated on a standard dataset from the sentiment analysis literature - the MPQA dataset.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:56Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

From an engineering perspective to understanding the mechanism of increased fragility with osteoporosis, we applied engineering theory to study this complex composite material, bone. Amount of bone, bone distribution, and tissue material properties are determinants of whole bone strength. Parathyroid hormone (PTH, teriparatide, hPTH [1-34]) is a FDA-approved anabolic osteoporosis treatment. PTH has shown to reduce fracture risk by over 50% and increased bone volume fraction. However, the alterations in material properties and mechanical properties with PTH treatment, and the correlations to bone mechanical failure are unknown. The objectives of this research were to 1) examine alterations in microstructure and tissue properties of both cortical and cancellous bone with PTH treatment using an osteopenia sheep model, and 2) investigate the influence of microstructure and anisotropic material properties on crack propagation in a pre-notched cortical beam under bending.  	To investigate the alterations in tissue properties across different length scales, a large, multi-level experiment was designed for both cortical and cancellous bone in an osteopenia sheep model. The first study focused on cortical bone and the effect of PTH treatment was greater at the micro- and nanoscale than at the whole bone level. There was no difference with whole-bone strength; however, fatigue life has shown to increase compared to other bisphosphonate-treated samples whereas fracture toughness was decreased in PTH-treated group and osteon density was higher. Furthermore, mineralization increased whereas indentation modulus decreased and hardness reduced with PTH treatment. Millimeter and nano-scale material properties were correlated with whole bone strength, but fatigue properties correlated little to bending strength or fracture toughness.  In the second study, cancellous bone was examined. There was no difference in monotonic compressive strength with PTH treatment; however, PTH-treated group preserved mechanical properties during cyclic loading compared to vehicle group. Additionally, PTH increased the volume fraction of rod-type trabeculae and decreased mineralization whereas nanoindentaion and hardness were not different. Correlating tissue composition, microstructure, and mechanical performance, energy dissipation was highly correlated with volume fraction of rods and mineralization.  	In the third study, fracture behavior in a single pre-notched cortical bone tissue was examined with finite element based simulation software (FRANC2D). The role of anisotropy of fracture toughness and of altered microstructure in crack trajectory and the force needed to propagate a crack was investigated. Cortical bone with more osteons located further away from the applied loads to maximize intact material would withstand more load before propagating cracks and fracturing."		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:57Z (GMT).

(5-HT) modulates for olfactory behavior and network physiology. 5-HT is a
neuromodulator which has been associated with a variety of neural functions including
rhythmic pattern generation, reward processing, and sensory processing. I first focused
my attention on how 5-HT may modulate olfactory guided behavior using a behavioral
pharmacological approach. Within the habituation task we found that infusion of a 5-
HT2 receptor antagonist, cinanserin, impaired habituation memory at low (0.001 Pa)
odor concentrations, and impaired spontaneous discrimination at all odor
concentrations test (0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 Pa). Within the forced choice discrimination
task we found a significant reduction in task performance following cinanserin
infusion. When sampling behavior and decision times were analyzed, we found that
cinanserin infusion significantly increased decision latencies only at one carbon
difference tests at 0.01 and 0.1 Pa concentrations. While rats were slower to choose
the odor pots at these odor concentrations they were equivalent in accuracy in the task.
Put in a speed/accuracy tradeoff context, we found that when animals were asked to
discriminate between similar odorants, accuracy is maintained and the expense of
speed. Later in my Ph.D. work I moved to studying how 5-HT modulates the olfactory
bulb network activity using an extracellular multi-electrode array. Utilizing a
horizontal brain slice preparation, I performed extracellular recordings followingserotonin application and the use the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, cinanserin. Using
signal processing techniques, we analyzed the effects of 5-HT on multiunit activity
(MUA) and local field potentials (LFP). Within the LFP we focused our analysis on
two frequency bands, theta (1-10 Hz) and gamma (20-55 Hz). We found that 5-HT
increased MUA and increased power in both the theta and gamma bands. These
effects were shown to be 5-HT2 receptor dependent because they were not detected
when slices were first perfused with cinanserin. These behavioral and physiological
results demonstrate that 5-HT2 receptors are necessary for non-associative and

In literary studies, it traces the trajectory of first-person narratives in medical writings and treatises as they move from iterations of self-care to demonstrations of self-fashioning. It also expands our understanding of early modern autobiographical writing beyond the borders of the literary canon by unearthing new archives of the self in medical discourse. In medical humanities, it refreshes the perspective on the establishment of medical authority by foregrounding rhetorical negotiations in rarely explored archives. In gender studies, it showcases women‚Äôs efforts to protect and maintain the uniqueness of fundamental practices such as touching and caring for pain. By paying close attention to a plurality of representations of experience-based medical knowledge, this project demonstrates the co-existence of various ethics of medicine and underlines how emerging male-midwives endeavored to appropriate traditionally female practices in order to rewrite them as male in their dominant discourse on the body.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:10Z (GMT).

The past few decades have been marked by a significant increase in our appreciation for the central role that splicing plays in regulating eukaryotic gene expression. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which this process is normally regulated, and can be mis-regulated with pathological consequences, remain poorly understood.
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have had a profound effect on our understanding of pre-mRNA splicing. Yet in spite of the power presented by this approach, it is less widely appreciated that the depth of sequencing necessary to quantitatively detect many splicing isoforms is significantly higher than most RNA-Seq experiments generate. Here I present the development and implementation of a novel sequencing method designed to harness the quantitative power of sequencing while focusing it on user-selected splice junctions of interest through targeting for introns at the reverse transcription step. This approach can dramatically enrich the fraction of reads in each sequencing experiment that are informative about splicing status, and in doing so enable a significant increase in the precision with which changes in splicing can be detected, all while decreasing experimental costs."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:59Z (GMT).

Because skyrmions can be smaller than the domain size in a ferromagnet, they are promising candidates for high density information storage. Finding an efficient way to create and annihilate individual skyrmions under ambient conditions is an important first step toward realizing skyrmion-based technologies. In this dissertation, I will discuss two experiments where we attempt to create a static or dynamic skyrmion in cobalt / platinum bilayers using a spin valve like device geometry.  I will also cover in detail the growth and characterization of the perpendicularly magnetized Co/Pt films necessary for this work.
The first project involves a hard Co/Pt bilayer with a strong Dzyaloshinskii Moriya Interaction, in addition to strong perpendicular anisotropy.  Micromagnetic simulations have predicted that it should be possible to excite skyrmion dynamics in such systems using a spin polarized current.  Although our experimental results are inconclusive, we have developed a fabrication process and measurement techniques that will be useful for future investigation of dynamics in similar materials.
The second project is related, but instead uses very soft Co/Pt bilayers, which show chiral stripe domains at zero field.  We are able to separate out the behavior of the film beneath the nanopillar from the bulk film and show that the two switch independently of each other.  This indicates that there is some sort of domain, potentially a skyrmion, that we are able to control separately from the rest of the film.  This project is a good first step toward controlling and creating room temperature skyrmions using spin transfer torque."		12/18/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:14:59Z (GMT).

The results indicate that virtual reality can facilitate heritage preservation through improved visual presentation and interpretation of site content, tourism management, documentation technology, public participation, and cross-cultural communication.  Virtual reality technology challenges traditional preservation norms as it generates an immersive environment that meets the needs of a wider audience, regardless of place and time.  Virtual reality technology enhances the interactive experience between heritage objects and users.  As is the case for all human-computer interactions, virtual reality technology has a cultural component, which requires further research.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:11Z (GMT).

Collecting sound baseline data becomes critical when seeking out the most significant contributors to spawning stock and flux. Sensitivity analyses can be employed to assess the range of uncertainty as it pertains to the estimation and application of these aforementioned contributors, however, hierarchical modeling, spatio-temporal visualization, and the cross validation of estimation methods provides a suitable means for addressing this uncertainty and the associated methods required for its reduction (Sullivan and Rudstam, 2016). With consistently measured baseline data collected and uncertainty fully characterized, one can utilize parametric optimization as a mechanism for inferring wide spread population phenomena from more localized estimates (Tam et al., 2002).  Custom designed egg mats were deployed in Black Creek (Esopus, New York) and the Fall Kill (Poughkeepsie, New York) to obtain spawning river herring egg counts for abundance modeling and subsequent population estimation. Geographic coordinates (NAD 1983 UTM Zone 18N) were recorded at sites of egg collection, and kernel density based functions in GIS were used to visualize the spatial distribution and estimated counts of river herring throughout a given system. The sites of greatest egg deposition were ultimately viewed in conjunction with their relative proximity to the first impassable barrier to anadromous fish migration. The coordination of these activities serve to either refute or support the future augmentation of barriers to fish migration, management of habitat, prioritization of project management, and potential implementation of supplemental fish passage within tributaries of the Hudson River. Gravid female river herring were sampled from the main stem of the Hudson River through the use of haul seines for post-mortem ovary analysis. Auto-enumeration of ovary egg contents using an Epson Perfection V19 flatbed scanner and ImageJ software allowed for fecundity analysis. Standardized river herring standing egg crop (mean egg count per female) was multiplied by female river herring population estimates, obtained from Delta Vision HD underwater camera counts and Smith-Root SR-1601 potentiometric fish counts, in order to further estimate egg productivity within a system. Delta Vision HD underwater camera daily population estimates were compared against Smith-Root SR-1601 estimates to address issues of double counting, fiscal cost, cumbrous technology, and accuracy.

The revisions entered into law not only at a time when the former authoritarian party controlled both the executive and legislative bodies, but also in an international setting marked by an onslaught of anti-labor legislation and austerity measures. Adopting a broadly Polanyian theoretical framework, this study illuminates historical processes of social resistance and political change underlying the seemingly paradoxical 2011 reforms. It argues that the former authoritarian party implemented the reforms in order to fragment organized opposition to cross-Strait economic liberalization. The pro-labor reforms therefore served to expand and deepen an emerging cross-Strait neoliberal policy regime while sidelining concerns over the potential socio-political and economic implications of free market integration with China.

Three families of Bacillales are analyzed in this work: (i) Listeriaceae (represented by Listeria monocytogenes), (ii) Paenibacillaceae (represented by Paenibacillus), and (iii) Bacillaceae (represented by the Bacillus cereus group). These families impact both food safety and food quality. Most Listeriaceae are non-pathogenic, but L. monocytogenes has one of the highest mortality rates of foodborne pathogens. Listeria spp. are often reported in food processing environments. Here, 4,430 environmental samples were collected from 9 small cheese-processing facilities and tested for Listeria and L. monocytogenes. Prevalence varied by processing facility, but across all facilities, 6.03 and 1.35% of samples were positive for L. monocytogenes and other Listeria spp., respectively. Each of these families contains strains capable of growth at refrigeration temperatures. To more broadly understand milk spoilage bacteria, genetic analyses were performed on 28 Paenibacillus and 23 B. cereus group isolates. While no specific genes were significantly associated with cold-growing Paenibacillus, the growth variation and vast genetic data introduced in this study provide a strong foundation for the development of detection strategies. Some species within the B. cereus group have previously been shown to grow at refrigeration temperatures, but the genetic analyses provided here will be of importance for the development of screening tools and to more successfully assess spoilage risk. Overall, the work presented here covers groups of bacteria that are common challenges for the dairy industry and provides large data sets to encourage additional research surrounding these topics.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:00Z (GMT).

They offer robust fault tolerance in exchange for probabilistic guarantees and convergence, and are characterized by elegance and simplicity.
This body of research considers the problem of gossip protocol representation and composition; that is, how to use simple gossip protocols as building blocks to form more complex and powerful compound protocols.
In doing so, we propose a novel formal representation of gossip, and use it to define the essential properties of gossip systems.
We propose composition operators that combine protocols, and show how properties of operands protocols are (or are not) transferred to the resulting compound protocols.
Choice among composition operators leads to trade-offs of performance and independence, while preserving semantics.
The optimization afforded by what we call ""correlated merge"" operator enables constructions that would be quite difficult to implement on their own by opportunistically combining gossip messages from many constituent protocols.
We discuss which practical syntactic features are helpful for gossip system implementation.
A proof-of-concept implementation named MiCA is presented, consisting of Java-language runtime for gossip, a library of gossip primitives, a simulator for rapid development, and visualization and analysis tools that can be used to interpret the results of experiments."

We study three different types of user feedback in three application setting: cardinal feedback with application in information filtering systems, ordinal feedback with application in personalized content recommender systems, and attribute feedback with application in review aggregators. We connect these settings respectively to existing work on classical multi-armed bandits, dueling bandits, and incentivizing exploration.  For each type of feedback and application setting, we provide an algorithm and a theoretical analysis bounding its regret. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that our algorithms outperform existing benchmarks.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:01Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The segregation of chromosomes at the first meiotic division is dependent in most organisms on at least one genetic exchange, or crossover event, between chromosome homologs. Homologs that do not receive a crossover frequently undergo nondisjunction at the first meiotic division, yielding aneuploid gametes. Such events have been linked to human disease and infertility.  Recent studies suggest that the Mlh1-Mlh3 complex is an endonuclease that resolves recombination intermediates into crossovers.  Interestingly, this complex also acts as a matchmaker in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) to remove DNA replication errors.  
How does Mlh1-Mlh3 act in two different processes?  I investigated this question by performing a mutational analysis of the baker‚Äôs yeast Mlh3 protein. This resulted in a comprehensive structure-function map that illustrates the effects of 60 new mlh3 alleles on both functions. From this map, I identified domains critical for one function but not the other. Five alleles (mlh3-6, -23, -42, -45, and -54) disrupt the MMR function while crossing over remains at nearly wild-type levels. Based on two-hybrid analysis, two of these five alleles (mlh3-42, and -54) disrupt interaction with Mlh1. This information suggests that the weakened Mlh1-mlh3 heterodimer is stabilized during crossing over by other protein factors. Alternatively, a weak defect in Mlh1-Mlh3 interaction may not be a limiting factor for crossover resolution in meiosis. In addition, I identified one allele (mlh3-32) that disrupted crossing over while maintaining nearly wild-type MMR. Mlh1-mlh3 representatives for each class were purified and characterized. Both Mlh1-mlh3-32 (MMR+, crossover-) and Mlh1-mlh3-45 (MMR-, crossover+) displayed wild-type endonuclease activities in vitro.  Msh2-Msh3, an MSH complex that acts with Mlh1-Mlh3 in MMR, stimulated the endonuclease activity of Mlh1-mlh3-32 but not Mlh1-mlh3-45, suggesting that Mlh1-mlh3-45 is defective in MSH interactions. Based on these and other observations, my work supports the model that protein-protein interactions with MMR or crossover specific factors are critical in regulating Mlh1-Mlh3‚Äôs enzymatic activity. 
Furthermore, I present five mlh3 mutations (mlh3-39, -40, -57, -58, 59) predicted to disrupt metal binding based on Pms1 structure, which conferred defects in both functions, suggesting the essential endonuclease active site in Mlh3 folds in a manner analogous to Pms1. Finally, whole genome recombination maps were constructed for wild-type and MMR+ crossover-, MMR- crossover+, endonuclease defective and null mlh3 mutants in an S288c/YJM789 hybrid background.  Compared to wild-type, all of the mlh3 mutants showed increases in the number of noncrossover events, consistent with recombination intermediates being resolved through alternative recombination pathways. Together, these data illustrate how defective meiotic components can alter the fate of meiotic recombination intermediates, providing new insights into how meiotic recombination pathways are regulated."

The first two chapters provide empirical evidence of hot-hand bias in two novel field settings: dart players' strategic choices, and physicians' decisions during childbirth. The ‚Äúhot hand‚Äù refers to the notion that a person can enter a state in which her probability of success becomes higher than normal. Regardless of whether the person actually has a hot hand, the ‚Äúhot-hand bias‚Äù is when the person has an exaggerated belief about the hot hand. In Chapter 1, I collect data of professional dart players from the 2016 World Darts Championship. I find that players are significantly more likely to hit after a successful shot, implying that players have a hot hand. Based on a precise estimate of the hot hand, I calculate the optimal strategy of a profit-maximizing dart player. I find that dart players are much more willing to take risks after a successful shot than what I calculate to be optimal, consistent with hot-hand bias. In Chapter 2, I utilize 1.3 million hospital admissions for childbirth in New York State over 2010-2015. I find no evidence that physicians have a hot hand when performing obstetrical procedures. In the absence of hot hand, physicians are still 2% more likely to perform a C-section after a previous successful C-section. My empirical model includes physician fixed effects and a large set of patient conditions that proxy for when a C-section is likely to maximize patient welfare. Robustness checks provide additional evidence consistent with decision-makers having hot-hand bias. Assuming that the identified 2% increase in the C-section rate is unwarranted, the estimated health-care cost is $65 million per year in the US. Chapter 3 is joint work with Nicolas Ziebarth. We investigate the relationship between sleep and health using a census of 160 million hospital admissions from Germany and 3.4 million survey responses from the US over one decade. We exploit the exogenous extension of sleep when daylight saving time ends: setting clocks back by one hour in the fall significantly extends night's sleep and reduces self-reported tiredness for four days following the time shift. In turn, we find that self-reported health improves and hospital admissions decrease significantly for about four days.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:58Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The relational composition refers to a venture team‚Äôs internal network. The extent to which the team composition depends on one type of social relations rather than another produces different organizational characteristics and bring important implications for its later outcomes. This research particularly focuses on the distinction between family and non-family affiliations and investigates the formation and evolution of such team composition as an input as well as an output. In the first empirical chapter, I examine the role of entrepreneur‚Äôs gender in the relational composition of venture businesses by focusing both on who creates a team rather than developing a single-owned enterprise, and on who creates a team with family members rather than non-family members. By analyzing venture businesses in the U.S., I find that females are constrained to establishing solo businesses in comparison to males. Also, when they establish an entrepreneurial team, female entrepreneurs tend to utilize family ties rather than work-related ties compared to their male counterpart. The second empirical study examines how the relational composition of venture teams influences its membership change. In this study, I introduce a new typology of venture teams based on the relational composition: family-only teams, non-family teams, and family/non-family mixed teams. Based on this typology, I find that family-only teams have the most stable structure among the three types with the lowest level of team turnover. On the other hand, non-family teams have the most fluidic form with the highest levels of both member withdrawal and recruitment. Founders in mixed teams are more likely to leave their firms due to internal conflicts between different types of members, and this negative nature of mixed teams hinders a future recruitment of co-founders. Lastly, I shift my focus to the performance aspect of these teams in the final empirical study. Using a competing risks event history modeling, I find that family-only teams show the most successful performance propelled by strong cohesion among team members. On the other hand, mixed teams produce the least successful outcomes due to the faultlines between family and non-family members. All in all, the results reveal the strength of family-only entrepreneurial teams in both maintaining a stable structure and producing a favorable performance outcome, while showing the weakness of mixed teams with a fragile team structure and a negative performance outcome.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:12Z (GMT).

Tackling these problems
will give more insight into how their users use these online platforms with the hope that the results can be generalized to the offline world. Every major step in human history was accompanied by an innovation, from the time that mankind invented and mastered the production of fire, to the invention of the World Wide Web. The societal process of adopting innovations has been a case that has fascinated many researchers throughout the past century.
 Prior to the existence of online social networks, economists and sociologists were able to study these phenomena on small groups of people through microeconomics and microsociology. However, the data gathered from these online communities help us to take one step further, initiating studies on macroeconomic and macrosociologal problems‚Äîin addition to the previous two areas. Work in this thesis sheds light on the properties of both innovators and laggards, the expansion and adaptation of innovation, competition among innovations with the same purpose, and the eventual crowding out of competitor innovations in the target society. Lastly, we look at the bigger picture by studying the entire diffusion process as a whole, abstracting out a great deal of details. This offers a view on why every single idea, content, product, etc., fails to go viral."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:12Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In situ leaching offers a way to extract copper from the subsurface without costly fragmentation. Applicability of in situ leaching is limited to deposits where sufficient permeability and leachable copper mineralogy exists. A computational copper in situ leaching model was developed to forecast recovered solution composition. This requires incorporating chemical reaction kinetics, mass transfer, and hydrology. These phenomena act over a range of length scales from centimeters up to hundreds of meters. Laboratory-scale leaching of ore provided data which was used to develop a list of geochemical reactions and associated rate laws. The risk of short-circuiting was treated probabilistically through geostatistical analysis of hydrophysical flow profiles, fracture spacing from Florence Copper's drill core database, and pumping tests. The geochemical reaction set and the geostatistical characteristics of hydraulic conductivity were brought together in a MATLAB model with a plugin to link to Geochemist's Workbench for computing chemical reaction pathways. Results highlighted the importance of large-scale flow patterns in copper recovery. The second part of this work pertains to rare earth element separation with supercritical carbon dioxide. Rare earth nitrates can be complexed with tributyl phosphate, thus forming a metal-ligand complex which is soluble in supercritical CO2. Rare earth elements were recovered from roasted and sodium hydroxide digested bastn√§site concentrate using supercritical carbon dioxide extraction with nitric acid/tributyl phosphate adducts. A range of tributyl phosphate/nitric acid adduct compositions were tested. A drop in recovery at higher acidities may indicate condensation of aqueous droplets which create an equilibrium limitation. To investigate the role of water, neodymium and holmium nitrate were extracted into supercritical CO2 with varying amounts of tributyl phosphate and water. Absorption spectroscopy was used to measure supercritical metal and water concentrations. It was found that holmium is preferentially extracted over neodymium. The results indicated that supercritical CO2 can be used to extract and separate rare earth elements from primary materials.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:59Z (GMT).

Their temporalities create an excessive present, in which the past persists alongside a future that emerges concurrently through forms of daily practice. I intervene in debates in black studies scholarship between a pessimistic view that points backward, arguing that blackness is marked by social death, and an optimistic view that points forward, insisting that blackness exceeds slavery‚Äôs reach. Holding both views in tension, I illuminate the ‚Äúexcess‚Äù that undermines this binary. The law‚Äôs violence in its rendering of black bodies as fungible exceeds its capacity for justice, and yet blackness exceeds the reach of the law, never reducible to only the state of abjection conjured by the structuring power of white supremacy.    I theorize the excessive present through literature and performance in contrast to legal discourse ‚Äì notably the 1783 British case Gregson v Gilbert, which is striking because it records a massacre of 131 people as an insurance case, not a murder case. The 1781 Zong Massacre recurs through each of my chapters, via J.M.W. Turner‚Äôs 1840 painting The Slave Ship, David Dabydeen‚Äôs 1995 poem, ‚ÄúTurner,‚Äù M. NourbeSe Philip‚Äôs 2008 book of poetry Zong!, and Fred D‚ÄôAguiar‚Äôs 1997 novel Feeding the Ghosts. My first chapter examines the presence of Turner‚Äôs painting within Claudia Rankine‚Äôs 2014 Citizen: An American Lyric to understand how processes of subjection and abolition exceed the periodization of history. The second chapter meditates on the murder of Eric Garner to concretely situate periodization in relation to law and reads Dabydeen‚Äôs poem and Angelina Weld Grimke‚Äôs 1916 play Rachel through debates about queer futurity. The third chapter develops an understanding of futurity and liberatory potentials in Philip‚Äôs Zong! alongside texts by Harriet Jacobs and Sutton Griggs. Finally, the fourth chapter examines neo-slave narratives by Toni Morrison, Sherley Anne Williams, and D‚ÄôAguiar to show how these novels articulate the excessive present as an ethical problem which calls for readers to enact abolitionist politics after the moment of reading ends.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:52Z (GMT).

In its pure and defect-free form, calcite is relatively soft and brittle. Amazingly though, despite its intrinsic shortcomings as a structural material, calcite often serves a structural purpose in biology. For example, the teeth, shells, and spines of many marine organisms contain, or are entirely composed of, calcite. These biogenic calcite-containing structures are much stronger and tougher than a pure control calcite crystal, and small-scale indentation testing suggests that even the single-crystals of calcite that make up these structures may be significantly harder than a pure control. The exact mechanisms of the increased hardness are not known, thus there is much interest in creating model synthetic calcite crystals to replicate and help explain such hardening effects. 
However, it is difficult to interpret the differences in hardness between different biogenic and synthetic calcites because the reference hardness of pure single-crystal calcite is not well known (there are large variations in previously-reported data). In this work, strides are made towards achieving a better understanding of the strengthening of biogenic and synthetic calcites in three ways: (1) Previous reports of the indentation hardness of calcite are compiled and compared, and new experiments are performed to quantify the effect of the indentation size effect and crystal anisotropy on hardness measurements of calcite. (2) A new indentation method is developed that allows for accurate measurements to be made on small, embedded particles (like biogenic and synthetic calcite crystals), by accounting for the effect of a dissimilar matrix material. And (3) it is demonstrated that the hardness of pure synthetic calcite crystals can be increased by simply varying the kinetics of their growth. Additionally, previously published collaborative work (included in the Appendix) explains an important impurity-based strengthening mechanism in calcite."		12/18/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:02Z (GMT).

The past few decades have been marked by a significant increase in our appreciation for the central role that splicing plays in regulating eukaryotic gene expression. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which this process is normally regulated, and can be mis-regulated with pathological consequences, remain poorly understood.
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have had a profound effect on our understanding of pre-mRNA splicing. Yet in spite of the power presented by this approach, it is less widely appreciated that the depth of sequencing necessary to quantitatively detect many splicing isoforms is significantly higher than most RNA-Seq experiments generate. Here I present the development and implementation of a novel sequencing method designed to harness the quantitative power of sequencing while focusing it on user-selected splice junctions of interest through targeting for introns at the reverse transcription step. This approach can dramatically enrich the fraction of reads in each sequencing experiment that are informative about splicing status, and in doing so enable a significant increase in the precision with which changes in splicing can be detected, all while decreasing experimental costs."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:13Z (GMT).

It has also proven effective for load bearing structural implants, for addressing craniomaxillofacial reconstruction, and airway obstructions. To date, however, there are no clinical examples of additively manufactured soft devices. In this thesis, I will present an approach for the rapid prototyping of a patient-specific left atrial appendage (LAA) occluder via 3D printing and static molding of inflatable silicone/polyurethane balloons. The LAA is a structure known to be highly variable in geometry and the primary source of stroke for patients with atrial fibrillation. I describe the design workflow, fabrication, and deployment of these patient-specific occluders as a proof-of-concept, and show their efficacy using 3D printed anatomic models, in vitro flow loops, and an in vivo large animal model. My work demonstrates the first patient-specific LAA occluder. This occluder could offer a non-pharmacological alternative to current methods, particularly in cases where the morphology causes occlusion to be challenging. Additionally, the design process and manufacturing methods I present could be used in any application where patient-specificity and soft materials are necessary. 
Proper delivery and deployment of LAA occluders requires exquisite knowledge of spatial orientation in delicate and complex anatomy. While real-time 3D ultrasound offers excellent navigation and interaction with soft-tissues, it requires a high level of expertise and implant materials with distinct ultrasound signatures for proper visualization and orientation. By incorporating sensory feedback into the skin of occluders, it could mitigate the need for complex imaging and expert skills. These skins would provide direct feedback of their degree of inflation as well as contact pressure with surrounding tissues. In my thesis, I will show my work on soft, stretchable sensors that can be directly printed onto pre-fabricated devices via direct ink writing. This printing technique uses two inks‚Äîan ionically conductive hydrogel and an electrically insulating silicone‚Äîwhich are patterned and photopolymerized into capacitive sensors. When printed onto a pneumatically actuated haptic device, these sensors enabled the detection of a compressive force of ~2 N, and an internal pressurization of as low as ~ 10 kPa."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:02Z (GMT).

The parent state of iron-based superconductors is most often a collinear antiferromagnet that breaks the tetragonal symmetry of the high temperature phase. Such a magnetically ordered state is accompanied by an orthorhombic lattice distortion and the nematic ordering of electronic degrees of freedom. Intriguingly, FeSe is an iron-based superconductor that realizes nematic ordering in the absence of any long range magnetic order. A recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiment deduced the superconducting gap structure of FeSe suggesting that in this material orbital selectivity plays a significant role in superconducting pairing. Within a multi-orbital Hubbard model for iron-based superconductors, such orbital selectivity is expected and driven by a sizable Hund's coupling. In this thesis, I use STM to visualize quasiparticle interference patterns in the unusual nematic state of FeSe. The analysis of these patterns demonstrates that the quasi-particle weight is significantly larger for the $d_{yz}$ orbitals than for the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{xy}$ orbitals. This establishes the existence of strong orbital-selective correlations in FeSe. Additionally, I identify significant directionality in the atomic structure of local density of states images in FeSe at low temperature. This is a novel method for visualizing nematicity in iron-based superconductors.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:22:59Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The primary application is to a realistic model of Bonneville Power Administration, which is a large wind power and hydropower producer in the Pacific Northwest. The objective is to determine the optimal amount of power to buy and sell on the day and hour ahead markets conditioned on the wind power forecast, as well as how much water to release from each reservoir.
The second Chapter in this dissertation develops the Fitting via Unimodal Approximation Optimization (FUA) method for more accurately approximating the value function in ADP with a Feedforward Neural Network with one hidden layer (FFNN1).  A major part of FUA is the new Unimodal Approximation Optimization (UAO) algorithm that is used to perform FFNN1 hyperparameter optimization. UAO can be applied to optimization problems with a discrete domain and a noisy unimodal objective function, and it is proven that UAO converges almost surely to the correct solution. Results on two control problems with 4, 12 and 15 state space dimensions show that approximating the value function in ADP with an FFNN1 using FUA yields a more accurate control solution in less time as compared to using other methods of fitting an FFNN1.
Chapter 3 presents the Long Term Generation method that generates long-term synthetic wind power scenarios conditioned on historical sequential short-term wind power forecasts. Power systems with wind power integration can be simulated on this data in order to more accurately evaluate the performance of their control policies.  Additionally, the Joint Distribution Comparison test is developed to evaluate the quality of these synthetic scenarios.
Finally, in Chapter 4 a stochastic rolling horizon model of Bonneville Power Administration is developed and the resulting control problem is solved using the ADP algorithm developed in Chapter 2 and is evaluated using data generated in Chapter 3.

Because skyrmions can be smaller than the domain size in a ferromagnet, they are promising candidates for high density information storage. Finding an efficient way to create and annihilate individual skyrmions under ambient conditions is an important first step toward realizing skyrmion-based technologies. In this dissertation, I will discuss two experiments where we attempt to create a static or dynamic skyrmion in cobalt / platinum bilayers using a spin valve like device geometry.  I will also cover in detail the growth and characterization of the perpendicularly magnetized Co/Pt films necessary for this work.
The first project involves a hard Co/Pt bilayer with a strong Dzyaloshinskii Moriya Interaction, in addition to strong perpendicular anisotropy.  Micromagnetic simulations have predicted that it should be possible to excite skyrmion dynamics in such systems using a spin polarized current.  Although our experimental results are inconclusive, we have developed a fabrication process and measurement techniques that will be useful for future investigation of dynamics in similar materials.
The second project is related, but instead uses very soft Co/Pt bilayers, which show chiral stripe domains at zero field.  We are able to separate out the behavior of the film beneath the nanopillar from the bulk film and show that the two switch independently of each other.  This indicates that there is some sort of domain, potentially a skyrmion, that we are able to control separately from the rest of the film.  This project is a good first step toward controlling and creating room temperature skyrmions using spin transfer torque."		12/18/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:13Z (GMT).

NOM in water has a significant effect on drinking water treatment. The presence of NOM can create a need for increased coagulant doses in drinking water treatment. Humic and fulvic materials represent up to 70% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and are major components of NOM. This work evaluated the effect of humic acids on the particle size distribution of flocs and settled effluent turbidity for a synthetic surface water treated with polyaluminum chloride (PACl) as coagulant.  Results obtained from this study indicate that the presence of NOM increased the concentration of flocs and shifted the particle size distribution toward smaller particle sizes with a concurrent increase in the effluent turbidity. A mechanistically based hydraulic flocculation model, which takes effects of humic acids into account, was developed in this research based on observations of residual turbidity. The model was validated by successfully predicting data from independent experiments. The predictive model provides a useful guideline for effective coagulant dosages in water treatment.

The proposed image editing approach effectively combines the strengths of two prominent images editing algorithms, conditional Generative Adversarial Networks[16] and Deep Feature Interpolation[19], to be time-efficient, memory-efficient, and user-controllable. We also present an inverted deep convolutional network to facilitate the proposed image editing approach. Lastly, we describe the implementation of this image editing approach in an iOS application and demonstrate that this approach is feasible and practical in real-world applications.

Three families of Bacillales are analyzed in this work: (i) Listeriaceae (represented by Listeria monocytogenes), (ii) Paenibacillaceae (represented by Paenibacillus), and (iii) Bacillaceae (represented by the Bacillus cereus group). These families impact both food safety and food quality. Most Listeriaceae are non-pathogenic, but L. monocytogenes has one of the highest mortality rates of foodborne pathogens. Listeria spp. are often reported in food processing environments. Here, 4,430 environmental samples were collected from 9 small cheese-processing facilities and tested for Listeria and L. monocytogenes. Prevalence varied by processing facility, but across all facilities, 6.03 and 1.35% of samples were positive for L. monocytogenes and other Listeria spp., respectively. Each of these families contains strains capable of growth at refrigeration temperatures. To more broadly understand milk spoilage bacteria, genetic analyses were performed on 28 Paenibacillus and 23 B. cereus group isolates. While no specific genes were significantly associated with cold-growing Paenibacillus, the growth variation and vast genetic data introduced in this study provide a strong foundation for the development of detection strategies. Some species within the B. cereus group have previously been shown to grow at refrigeration temperatures, but the genetic analyses provided here will be of importance for the development of screening tools and to more successfully assess spoilage risk. Overall, the work presented here covers groups of bacteria that are common challenges for the dairy industry and provides large data sets to encourage additional research surrounding these topics.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:14Z (GMT).

Matsudaira, Jordan D.||Fitzpatrick, Maria D.||Bohlmark, Anders	2018-10-22T17:23:01Z			5/30/18		This dissertation consists of three essays, each using advanced empirical methods to address important questions within the fields of labor and education economics.   In Chapter 1, I exploit a Swedish reform that eliminated the fixed national pay scale for teachers to present novel evidence on the labor market effects of wage decentralization. Identification of the causal effect of the reform is achieved by using differences in non-teacher wages across local labor markets prior to the reform as a measure of treatment intensity in a dose-response difference-in-difference framework. I find that decentralization induces large changes in teacher pay, and that these changes are entirely financed through a reallocation of existing education resources. The magnitude of the wage effect is negatively related to teacher age, such that the reform led to a disproportionate increase in entry wage and a flattening of the age-wage relationship. Contrary to the predictions of the Roy model, decentralization does not impact teacher composition or student outcomes. I show that a main reason for this relates to general equilibrium and wage spillover effects to substitute occupations.   In Chapter 2, which is joint work with Anders B√∂hlmark, we examine how ethnic residential segregation affects long-term outcomes of immigrants and natives. The key challenge with identifying neighborhood effects is that individuals sort across regions for reasons that are unobserved by the researcher but relevant as determinants of individual outcomes. Such nonrandom selection leads to invalid inference in correlational studies since individuals in neighborhoods with different population compositions are not comparable even after adjusting for differences in observable characteristics. To overcome this issue, we borrow theoretical insight from the one-sided tipping point model used by Card, Mas and Rothstein (2008). This model predicts that residential segregation can arise due to social interactions in white preferences: once the minority share in a neighborhood passes a certain ‚Äútipping point,‚Äù the neighborhood will be subject to white flight and avoidance, causing a discontinuity in white population growth. After having found evidence for the tipping phenomenon in Sweden, we use the tipping threshold as a source of exogenous variation in population composition to provide new evidence on the effect of neighborhood segregation on individual outcomes. We find negative effects on the educational attainment of native children. These effects are temporary and do not carry over to the labor market. We show that these transitory education effects are isolated to natives who leave tipped areas, suggesting that they may be driven by short-term disruptions caused by moving.  In Chapter 3, which is joint work with Michael Lovenheim, we analyze the effect of teacher collective bargaining laws on long-run labor market and educational attainment outcomes, exploiting the timing of passage of duty-to-bargain (DTB) laws across cohorts within states and across states over time. We find robust evidence that exposure to teacher DTB laws worsens the future labor market outcomes of men: in the first 10 years after passage of a DTB law, male earnings decline by $1,974 (or 3.64%) per year and hours worked decrease by 0.43 hours per week. The earnings estimates for men indicate that teacher collective bargaining reduces earnings by $198.1 billion in the US annually. We also find evidence of lower male employment rates. Exposure to DTB laws leads to reductions in the skill levels of the occupations into which male workers sort as well. Effects are largest among black and Hispanic men. Estimates among women are often confounded by secular trend variation, though we do find suggestive evidence of negative impacts among non-white women. Using data from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we demonstrate that DTB laws lead to reductions in measured non-cognitive skills among young men.		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:01Z (GMT).

The bulk of my dissertation work focuses on the development and application of technologies to quantify the contribution of nuclear envelope proteins to the mechanical wiring within living cells. These powerful assays enable measurements of nuclear deformations, nuclear movements (e.g., during muscle differentiation) and nucleo-cytoskeletal force transmission in response to both intra- and extracellular-generated forces.  Diseases caused by mutations in genes encoding nuclear envelope proteins, such as Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, often have convoluted mechanisms due to the multifaceted role of the nuclear envelope in a variety of biochemical and mechanical cellular processes. Therefore, the assays presented herein are particularly valuable in determining the relative contribution of certain proteins to cellular health and disease when they are absent or mutated.  While much of my work supports the idea that that mutations in nuclear envelope proteins cause mechanical defects that render the nucleus less stable and more susceptible to physical damage that results in disease, I have also begun investigating whether nuclear envelope proteins can instantaneously translate mechanical force into transcriptional changes, thus addressing a major question in the field of mechanobiology.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:02Z (GMT).

This technique is based on sol-gel processing followed by electric-field induced kinetic-demixing and high temperature calcination. Demixing conditions play a vital role in the sheet growth. Kinetic demixing under different temperatures (300‚Äì500¬∫C), electrical currents of 500 mA and 750 mA, and duration times between 0-60 hours were tested to establish relationships between kinetic demixing conditions and the length of sheets. An embedding and polishing method was developed for this fragile material. The hardness and reduced modulus of Na0.7CoO2 with nanolayered structure are reported for the first time based on nanoindentation tests. The correlation between the mechanical properties and the structure of the nanolayered materials is reported. A deformation mechanism for nanolayers is suggested based on layer sliding. Aging problems associated with this material are also reported for the first time.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:04Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We study three different types of user feedback in three application setting: cardinal feedback with application in information filtering systems, ordinal feedback with application in personalized content recommender systems, and attribute feedback with application in review aggregators. We connect these settings respectively to existing work on classical multi-armed bandits, dueling bandits, and incentivizing exploration.  For each type of feedback and application setting, we provide an algorithm and a theoretical analysis bounding its regret. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that our algorithms outperform existing benchmarks.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:15Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In its pure and defect-free form, calcite is relatively soft and brittle. Amazingly though, despite its intrinsic shortcomings as a structural material, calcite often serves a structural purpose in biology. For example, the teeth, shells, and spines of many marine organisms contain, or are entirely composed of, calcite. These biogenic calcite-containing structures are much stronger and tougher than a pure control calcite crystal, and small-scale indentation testing suggests that even the single-crystals of calcite that make up these structures may be significantly harder than a pure control. The exact mechanisms of the increased hardness are not known, thus there is much interest in creating model synthetic calcite crystals to replicate and help explain such hardening effects. 
However, it is difficult to interpret the differences in hardness between different biogenic and synthetic calcites because the reference hardness of pure single-crystal calcite is not well known (there are large variations in previously-reported data). In this work, strides are made towards achieving a better understanding of the strengthening of biogenic and synthetic calcites in three ways: (1) Previous reports of the indentation hardness of calcite are compiled and compared, and new experiments are performed to quantify the effect of the indentation size effect and crystal anisotropy on hardness measurements of calcite. (2) A new indentation method is developed that allows for accurate measurements to be made on small, embedded particles (like biogenic and synthetic calcite crystals), by accounting for the effect of a dissimilar matrix material. And (3) it is demonstrated that the hardness of pure synthetic calcite crystals can be increased by simply varying the kinetics of their growth. Additionally, previously published collaborative work (included in the Appendix) explains an important impurity-based strengthening mechanism in calcite."		12/18/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:16Z (GMT).

Birds are the largest parental vertebrate clade as 98% of avian species provide some variation of parental care. Despite this, we still know surprisingly little about the neuroendocrine regulation of avian parental care. Neuroendocrine systems have long been thought to play an important role in the onset of parental care as they are known to regulate various aspects of both physiology and behavior. In virtually all birds that raise altricial young, circulating prolactin (PRL) levels are generally low during non-breeding times, but significantly increase during late incubation and early post-hatch care. Because of this pattern, PRL has been suggested to be involved in the initiation of parental care in birds, but rarely has this hypothesis been causally tested. This dissertation provides the first descriptive studies of PRL‚Äôs relationship with breeding cycle stages and reproductive experience (chapter 1) and the relationship between PRL and variation in post-hatch parental behavior (chapter 2) in the socially monogamous and biparental zebra finch. In chapters 3 and 4, we provide the first causal evidence that PRL plays a role in the onset of zebra finch parental behavior and show that reproductive experience positively affects parental behavior. Lastly, in chapter 5, we provide the first description of the central PRL receptor (PRLR) in the brains of male and female zebra finches and show how the PRLR distribution is significantly affected by breeding status by comparing the PRLR distribution between breeding and non-breeding brains.  This information is essential for continuing to test for a causal role in central PRL in parental care, for generalizing the role of PRL to other avian species, and for comparative analyses to help elucidate the evolution of parental care and other PRL-mediated behaviors.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:04Z (GMT).

It has also proven effective for load bearing structural implants, for addressing craniomaxillofacial reconstruction, and airway obstructions. To date, however, there are no clinical examples of additively manufactured soft devices. In this thesis, I will present an approach for the rapid prototyping of a patient-specific left atrial appendage (LAA) occluder via 3D printing and static molding of inflatable silicone/polyurethane balloons. The LAA is a structure known to be highly variable in geometry and the primary source of stroke for patients with atrial fibrillation. I describe the design workflow, fabrication, and deployment of these patient-specific occluders as a proof-of-concept, and show their efficacy using 3D printed anatomic models, in vitro flow loops, and an in vivo large animal model. My work demonstrates the first patient-specific LAA occluder. This occluder could offer a non-pharmacological alternative to current methods, particularly in cases where the morphology causes occlusion to be challenging. Additionally, the design process and manufacturing methods I present could be used in any application where patient-specificity and soft materials are necessary. 
Proper delivery and deployment of LAA occluders requires exquisite knowledge of spatial orientation in delicate and complex anatomy. While real-time 3D ultrasound offers excellent navigation and interaction with soft-tissues, it requires a high level of expertise and implant materials with distinct ultrasound signatures for proper visualization and orientation. By incorporating sensory feedback into the skin of occluders, it could mitigate the need for complex imaging and expert skills. These skins would provide direct feedback of their degree of inflation as well as contact pressure with surrounding tissues. In my thesis, I will show my work on soft, stretchable sensors that can be directly printed onto pre-fabricated devices via direct ink writing. This printing technique uses two inks‚Äîan ionically conductive hydrogel and an electrically insulating silicone‚Äîwhich are patterned and photopolymerized into capacitive sensors. When printed onto a pneumatically actuated haptic device, these sensors enabled the detection of a compressive force of ~2 N, and an internal pressurization of as low as ~ 10 kPa."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:17Z (GMT).

The Parlement de Toulouse was a court of final appeal that had jurisdiction over a large swath of Southern France, and that the kings used as a bureaucratic outpost to assert their authority over what had remained a rather unruly border-region. Through an analysis of the genealogy of ideas regarding kingship, justice, and the body social, an account of the material and temporal constraints of judicial activity, and a close examination of dozens of lawsuits involving all classes of men and women from the Languedoc region, this research transforms the extensive archive produced by this early-modern French court into a broad-ranging historical analysis that is at once cultural, intellectual, social, and political. The analysis of the court‚Äôs records, focused on the magistrates‚Äô professional practices‚Äîhow they investigated, interrogated, tortured, and sentenced litigants while at the same time translating social and political conflicts into legal statements of fact, demonstrates that the mutually constitutive relationship between ideals of justice and everyday judicial practices, was at the core of a judicial epistemology which, situated between facts and faith, calls for a revision of our understanding of the political role of those courts, and beyond, of our understanding of early-modern political culture.

Currently, a number of endeavors are being attempted to conserve chestnut resources in several locations throughout the country. However, only a small percentage of the total number of trees can benefit and there is no method in place for the strategic selection of tree varieties or regions for the implementation of blight control. The geographic region of highest genetic diversity, domestication and longest-standing cultivation of the European chestnut is in Eastern Turkey and the Caucasus. This research will explore the features of local genetic stewardship in the face of a disease epidemic by considering ethnographic, genetic, epidemiological, plant morphological and ethnobotanical attributes of a single species in a single region, the European sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) in Turkey. The four chapters of this dissertation, respectively, 1.) argue for consideration of folk value ‚Äì defined as value to cultural cohesion and survival ‚Äì in agricultural plant conservation; 2.) capture an instance of humans-as-landscape-members through documentation of immediate human niche construction and, its corollary, cultural resilience, in the form of community actions to tailor plant populations to conditions of increased pest and disease pressure brought on by economic globalization; 3.) demonstrate a method of engaging the muted biological knowledge of women and other marginalized groups; and 4.) demonstrate the power of folk value to motivate widespread biological conservation and to characterize ecological knowledge. These research products will inform on-going chestnut conservation activities, and in doing so, highlight the necessity and feasibility of conducting conservation programs which reinforce the livelihoods and cultural survival of local managing communities.

The dissertation shows how a persistent pattern of militant liberalism came to structure the postwar international order‚Äîone where the United States engages in militant action to protect the liberal international order from irredeemable illiberal threats, precisely when its hegemonic influence reaches its limit. While anti-totalitarianism and the war on terror are defining episodes in the development of this pattern, the dissertation argues that it was only liberalism‚Äôs encounter with decolonization that made the practice of militant liberalism ideologically coherent and enduring. After shattering the civilizational justifications of nineteenth century liberalism, decolonization provided militant liberals with a unique enemy, the Third World, upon which to distinguish and legitimate their own logic of violence, all while destroying alternative political possibilities arising out of the decolonial process.
The dissertation explores these themes through four political thinkers‚ÄîIsaiah Berlin, Louis Henkin, Frantz Fanon, and Carl Schmitt‚Äîand narrates a story about the legitimation of militant liberalism and the eventual rise of its discontents. On the one hand, Berlin and Henkin spoke of Thirdworldism as uniquely threatening: the former arguing that Thirdworldist nationalism often morphed into romantic self-assertion, and the latter claiming that Thirdworldists exploited state sovereignty allowing international terrorism to proliferate unbound. In response to these images, Berlin cast liberal violence as universal, ethically responsible, and hence morally superior to nationalist-inspired violence, while Henkin sympathized with US attempts to interpretively modify international law and drape itself under its authority as it hunted terrorists behind sovereign lines. On the other hand, Fanon and Schmitt, as critics of liberalism, challenged these pictures. The actors arising out of decolonization, they claimed, were neither driven by romantic self-assertion nor were they meaningfully sovereign. Instead, the authoritarian disasters and aggressive reactions of decolonization often stemmed from the interventions of militant liberalism and the aggravations of the liberal order itself. The prior accounts of decolonization disavowed liberalism‚Äôs complicity in fomenting the conditions that allowed it discontents to proliferate: global terrorism as the diametric force perpetuating endless warfare."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:05Z (GMT).

theory in the Hilbert space L2(R+) of the C0-semigroup P and its adjoint bP having
as generator, respectively, the Caputo and the right-sided Riemann-Liouville
fractional derivatives of index 1 < alpha < 2. These linear operators, which are nonlocal
and non-self-adjoint, appear in many recent studies in applied mathematics
and also arise as the infinitesimal generators of some substantial processes
such as the reflected spectrally negative alpha-stable process. We establish an intertwining
relationship between these semigroups and the semigroup of a Bessel
type process which is self-adjoint. Relying on this commutation identity, we
characterize the spectrum and the (weak) eigenfunctions and provide the spectral 
expansions of these semigroups on (at least) a dense subset of L2(R+). We
also obtain an integral representation of their transition kernels that enables to
derive regularity properties.
Inspired by this development, we further exploit, in the second part of this
dissertation, the concept of intertwining between general Markov semigroups.
More specifically, we start by showing that the intertwining relationship between
two minimal Markov semigroups acting on Hilbert spaces implies that
any recurrent extensions, in the sense of It ÀÜ o, of these semigroups satisfy the
same intertwining identity. Under mild additional assumptions on the intertwining
operator, we prove that the converse also holds. This connection enables
us to give an interesting probabilistic interpretation of intertwining relationships
between Markov semigroups via excursion theory: two such recurrent
extensions that intertwine share, under an appropriate normalization, the same
local time at the boundary point. Moreover, in the case when one of the (nonself-
adjoint) semigroup intertwines with the one of a quasi-diffusion, we obtain
an extension of Krein‚Äôs theory of strings by showing that its densely defined
spectral measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the measure appearing
in the Stieltjes representation of the Laplace exponent of the inverse local
time. Finally, we illustrate our results with the class of positive self-similar
Markov semigroups and also the reflected generalized Laguerre semigroups.
For the latter, we obtain their spectral decomposition and provide, under some
conditions, a perturbed spectral gap estimate for its convergence to equilibrium.
The third part of this dissertation is devoted to the applications of some of
these theoretical results to some substantial problems arising in financial mathematics.
Keeping in mind the fundamental theorem of asset pricing, we suggest
several transformations on a tractable and flexible Markov process (or equivalently,
its respective semigroup) in order that the discounted transformed process
becomes a (local) martingale while still keeping its tractability. In particular,
we suggest using an intertwining approach and/or Bochner‚Äôs subordination
(random time-change via a subordinator) to achieve this goal. Moreover,
in order to illustrate our approach, we discuss in details several examples that
include the class of L¬¥evy, self-similar and generalized CIR processes that reveal
the usefulness of our result. Furthermore, we provide for the non-self-adjoint
pricing semigroups associated to the latter family of processes a spectral expansions
on which we carry out some numerical analysis."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:06Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The primary application is to a realistic model of Bonneville Power Administration, which is a large wind power and hydropower producer in the Pacific Northwest. The objective is to determine the optimal amount of power to buy and sell on the day and hour ahead markets conditioned on the wind power forecast, as well as how much water to release from each reservoir.
The second Chapter in this dissertation develops the Fitting via Unimodal Approximation Optimization (FUA) method for more accurately approximating the value function in ADP with a Feedforward Neural Network with one hidden layer (FFNN1).  A major part of FUA is the new Unimodal Approximation Optimization (UAO) algorithm that is used to perform FFNN1 hyperparameter optimization. UAO can be applied to optimization problems with a discrete domain and a noisy unimodal objective function, and it is proven that UAO converges almost surely to the correct solution. Results on two control problems with 4, 12 and 15 state space dimensions show that approximating the value function in ADP with an FFNN1 using FUA yields a more accurate control solution in less time as compared to using other methods of fitting an FFNN1.
Chapter 3 presents the Long Term Generation method that generates long-term synthetic wind power scenarios conditioned on historical sequential short-term wind power forecasts. Power systems with wind power integration can be simulated on this data in order to more accurately evaluate the performance of their control policies.  Additionally, the Joint Distribution Comparison test is developed to evaluate the quality of these synthetic scenarios.
Finally, in Chapter 4 a stochastic rolling horizon model of Bonneville Power Administration is developed and the resulting control problem is solved using the ADP algorithm developed in Chapter 2 and is evaluated using data generated in Chapter 3.  The stochastic control formulation has a nonlinear objective function, 24 decision variables, and 16 state space dimensions."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:18Z (GMT).

DLBCL is a heterogeneous disease associated with a variety of clinical presentations and genetic diversity (1). The standard combination chemotherapy, Rituximab (R)-CHOP (doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, mechlorethamine) has been the frontline therapy for years, and still a significant percentage of DLBCL patients are not cured (2). Activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL is the most chemo-resistant DLBCL subtype to R-CHOP with a 5-year overall survival as low as 40% vs 80% for germinal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL (1, 3). A myriad of independently predictive biomarkers for resistance have been identified, including gene expression signature, stromal signatures, epigenetic silencing of specific genes, and specific somatic mutations (3, 4). But none is sufficient to predict resistance in a given patient and few are helpful in guiding the selection of targeted therapies. Therefore, new treatments and treatment-specific biomarkers are needed to improve clinical outcome of ABC-DLBCL. It is becoming increasingly evident that tumor microenvironment is an active participant in the progression and pathogenesis of lymphoma (5, 6). DLBCLs originate and reside in lymphoid tissues subjected characteristic lymphatic and vascular fluid forces, extracellular matrices, and cell-cell interactions with a variety of stromal and immune cells. In the context of ABC-DLBCL, which are the most chemoresistant subtypes, the hallmark ABC-DLBCL mutations result in constitutive activation of B cell receptor (BCR) pathways. Hence these pathways are emerging as a source of therapeutic targets for the treatment of these tumors. However to date, existing BCR pathway inhibitors such as those targeting Bruton‚Äôs tyrosine kinase (BTK) are active in a limited subset of patients and only for a short duration (few months). Therefore, there is a need to understand factors that modulate BCR. My dissertation focuses on three components of lymphoma microenvironment, namely (a) fluid shear stress and mass transport, (b) tissue stiffness, and (c) vascularization. To study the role of lymphatics-mediatedshear stress in DLBCLs, we engineered an integrated cell culture micro-reactor platform with micron-scale high resistance channels that recapitulates fluid flow velocities, pressure, and shear stresses developed in subcapsular sinuses of lymph nodes. The findings suggest that lymphatic-grade shear stress increases DLBCL cell proliferation and reduces chemotherapeutic responsiveness across DLBCL subtypes. The interplay of Œ±4Œ≤1-integrin, CD20, and B cell receptors guides DLBCLs to respond differentially to fluid shear stress and nutrient mass transport, by altering the phosphorylation of downstream signaling pathways. The dissertation next focuses on the role of mechanical stiffness of the malignant lymphoid tissues. The DLBCLs are commonly characterized by enlargement and palpable stiffness of lymph nodes. However, there are no studies on the quantification of tissue stiffness in lymphomas and on the role, it can play in tumor progression or therapeutic response. We first determined the strain energy density of freshly isolated healthy and tumorous mouse lymph nodes, as well as lymphoma tissue from a patient using a micropipette aspiration technique, previously applied to quantify the local stiffness measurement of soft tissues (7, 8). We next developed stiffness-matched hydrogels to elucidate the role of lymphoid tissue stiffness on proliferation, phenotype, and therapeutic response of DLBCLs. The final part of the dissertation focuses on a cellular component of DLBCL microenvironment ‚Äì the endothelial cells, which play an important role in angiogenesis. It is now increasingly recognized that DLBCLs are promoted by two angiogenic modes, firstly by autocrine signals via self-expressed VEGFR and VEGF, and secondly by paracrine signals of endothelial progenitors of the microenvironment (9). In this dissertation we present an engineered bio-artificial organoid platform to study the interaction between DLBCL and endothelial cells, the angiogenic component of lymphoma microenvironment. We demonstrate that two integrins Œ±4Œ≤1 and Œ±vŒ≤3, expressed by both DLBCLs and endothelial cells, modulate the VEGF, as well as CD20 and B cell receptor expressed by DLCBL cells. We anticipate that our engineered technology will be useful in study of lymphoma biology, and discovery and optimization of new class of therapeutics.

In the Icelandic fishery, data and information technology (IT) have been framed as solutions to overfishing and natural resource management for over thirty years. During this time, the Icelandic government has implemented a series of highly contested natural resource management schemes aimed to protect and preserve the economically valuable resource, from alternating between restrictions on access to the fishing grounds, capping the allowable fishing amount to restricting and limiting fishing efforts. Throughout these different system implementations, the common thread is a heavy reliance on data and technology as tools to control and manage the fishery sustainably. I argue that framing data as a solution to the issue of sustainability has narrowed our view of the fishery such that both the fish and the people relying on the resource disappear from view, being replaced by data.  In this dissertation, I present data from ethnographic research that demonstrate some of the unintended consequences that have unfolded as a result of this focus on data. I examine the datafication from the ground up, focusing on the perspective of fishermen and captains in particular. Starting with the the moment fish is transformed into data on board a freezer trawler in the North Atlantic, I demonstrate how the fish gain a new life as data with a variety of new roles, different meanings and accompanying political agendas. Next, I move on to examine changes in the work practices of captains. Looking at the day-to-day responsibilities of the captain, we see an ever-increasing role of governance and surveillance through IT and data. One unintended consequence of this is that the role of the captain - applied craftsman or a blue collar laborer - has expanded to include more white collar tasks without reaping any of the benefits that would come with such a shift (e.g. increased autonomy, elevation in status). Finally, I examine the historical context of the natural resource management system that has prompted these changes, demonstrating a feedback loop between data and new forms of governance.		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:04Z (GMT).

The over-arching theme is to examine natural and/or anthropogenic perturbations in species dynamics. This dissertation also extends the association of species dynamics in perturbed systems to fisher based economies and human-health. Given the spatial and temporal nature of biological systems, spatial models and spatial-temporal models are applied to understand system dynamics with environmental stochasticity as a key determinant. An integrated nested laplace approximation spatial-temporal model explains fisheries abundance, (2) spatial bionomic models identify optimal management strategies in a changing fishery, (3) conditional auto-regressive models explain spatial differences in fisher well-being. This thesis will test whether distribution of the summer flounder can be explained by regional climate driven increase in ocean temperature in the Mid-Altantic Bight, USA; develops three models calibrated to the Maine, USA green sea urchin fishery since 1995, that is used to test whether periodic closures are optimal to permit stock regeneration, or whether the creation of a marine reserve is optimal; provide empirical evidence to demonstrate a relationship between malnutrition in artisanal fisher communities an degradation in coral reef ecosystems in Indonesia. The results suggest that all management decisions take into consideration a precautionary approach that account for stochastic environmental events. Local sources of anthropogenic stressors should be mitigated, given that regional policies have a higher chance of ameliorating and off-setting global climate change stressors.

Some argue that ILMs have become an outdated HR strategy because the use of ILMs may inhibit the firms‚Äô capabilities to adapt to the changing environments. In this paper, I challenge that conventional wisdom and propose that ILMs have the potential to enhance a firm‚Äôs adaptability to uncertain environments by facilitating its knowledge creation process. Drawing on panel data from 271 manufacturing firms, this study demonstrates that firms making greater use of ILMs in competitive industries exhibit more effective implementation of organizational learning practices ‚Äì leading to higher knowledge creation.		12/20/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:06Z (GMT).

NOM in water has a significant effect on drinking water treatment. The presence of NOM can create a need for increased coagulant doses in drinking water treatment. Humic and fulvic materials represent up to 70% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and are major components of NOM. This work evaluated the effect of humic acids on the particle size distribution of flocs and settled effluent turbidity for a synthetic surface water treated with polyaluminum chloride (PACl) as coagulant.  Results obtained from this study indicate that the presence of NOM increased the concentration of flocs and shifted the particle size distribution toward smaller particle sizes with a concurrent increase in the effluent turbidity. A mechanistically based hydraulic flocculation model, which takes effects of humic acids into account, was developed in this research based on observations of residual turbidity. The model was validated by successfully predicting data from independent experiments. The predictive model provides a useful guideline for effective coagulant dosages in water treatment.

This technique is based on sol-gel processing followed by electric-field induced kinetic-demixing and high temperature calcination. Demixing conditions play a vital role in the sheet growth. Kinetic demixing under different temperatures (300‚Äì500¬∫C), electrical currents of 500 mA and 750 mA, and duration times between 0-60 hours were tested to establish relationships between kinetic demixing conditions and the length of sheets. An embedding and polishing method was developed for this fragile material. The hardness and reduced modulus of Na0.7CoO2 with nanolayered structure are reported for the first time based on nanoindentation tests. The correlation between the mechanical properties and the structure of the nanolayered materials is reported. A deformation mechanism for nanolayers is suggested based on layer sliding. Aging problems associated with this material are also reported for the first time.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:19Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Problems with establishment may be overcome by interseeding, where cover crops are seeded between rows of cash crops prior to harvest. Interseeded cover crops can provide greater ecosystem services than cover crops established after harvest, including erosion control and weed suppression. In addition to these services, interseeded cover crops might also provide habitat for invertebrate seed predators such as carabid beetles and crickets, which feed on weed seeds. We established a field experiment to investigate how cash crop planting density affects interseeded cover crop performance during the transition to certified organic production. We measured corn density, light transmission through the corn canopy, cover crop and weed biomass, and corn grain yield.  We analyzed the relationship between these factors with regression, mixed models, path analysis, and partial correlation. The effect of corn density on interseeded cover crop biomass was significant when quantified both directly and indirectly as mediated by light transmission and weed biomass. At the October sample date, weed biomass was 31% lower in plots with interseeded cover crops than plots without, and corn grain yield was not different between plots with interseeded cover crops and plots without. We also conducted a laboratory experiment to explore the potential for cover crop seeds to be eaten by weed seed predators. Using four common invertebrate weed seed predators and a series of No Choice and Choice feeding assays, we presented seeds of ten cover crop species and three weed species to individual carabid beetles and crickets. We analyzed No Choice preference with logistic regression and Choice with Vanderploeg and Scavia‚Äôs electivity index and mixed models. We found that all four invertebrate seed predators consumed cover crop seeds and that preference varied by plant species and insect species. Overall results show that cover crop interseeding can be used to overcome one of the primary barriers to cover crop adoption and provide ecosystem services, but that cover crop seeds are susceptible to seed predation and thus cover crop species selection and seeding method are important to consider.

also known as silent stroke since they do not illicit noticeable symptoms. Recently,
due to the development of various imaging modalities and aging population in the
western world, increasing number of CMBs are detected. Clinical studies have shown
that aging and hypertension significantly increases the chance of such bleeds and the
National Institute of Health recognizes CMBs as a major factor in Alzheimer disease
pathology. Independent events of CMBs are also a risk factor for subsequent larger
intracerebral hemorrhages, ischemic stroke, Binswager‚Äôs disease and Alzheimer‚Äôs
disease. However, studies in cellular level are lacking, partially due to inadequate
animal model that allow both detection and follow up analysis of such small bleeds.
We used tightly focused femtosecond laser pulses to injure single penetrating
arterioles in the cortex of live anesthetized rodents and used multi-photon excited
fluorescence imaging to quantify inflammatory responses over long periods of time.
The work presented in this dissertation provides comprehensive spatial and temporal
pathological consequences after micro scale hemorrhagic injury to a single blood

Birds are the largest parental vertebrate clade as 98% of avian species provide some variation of parental care. Despite this, we still know surprisingly little about the neuroendocrine regulation of avian parental care. Neuroendocrine systems have long been thought to play an important role in the onset of parental care as they are known to regulate various aspects of both physiology and behavior. In virtually all birds that raise altricial young, circulating prolactin (PRL) levels are generally low during non-breeding times, but significantly increase during late incubation and early post-hatch care. Because of this pattern, PRL has been suggested to be involved in the initiation of parental care in birds, but rarely has this hypothesis been causally tested. This dissertation provides the first descriptive studies of PRL‚Äôs relationship with breeding cycle stages and reproductive experience (chapter 1) and the relationship between PRL and variation in post-hatch parental behavior (chapter 2) in the socially monogamous and biparental zebra finch. In chapters 3 and 4, we provide the first causal evidence that PRL plays a role in the onset of zebra finch parental behavior and show that reproductive experience positively affects parental behavior. Lastly, in chapter 5, we provide the first description of the central PRL receptor (PRLR) in the brains of male and female zebra finches and show how the PRLR distribution is significantly affected by breeding status by comparing the PRLR distribution between breeding and non-breeding brains.  This information is essential for continuing to test for a causal role in central PRL in parental care, for generalizing the role of PRL to other avian species, and for comparative analyses to help elucidate the evolution of parental care and other PRL-mediated behaviors.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:20Z (GMT).

The Parlement de Toulouse was a court of final appeal that had jurisdiction over a large swath of Southern France, and that the kings used as a bureaucratic outpost to assert their authority over what had remained a rather unruly border-region. Through an analysis of the genealogy of ideas regarding kingship, justice, and the body social, an account of the material and temporal constraints of judicial activity, and a close examination of dozens of lawsuits involving all classes of men and women from the Languedoc region, this research transforms the extensive archive produced by this early-modern French court into a broad-ranging historical analysis that is at once cultural, intellectual, social, and political. The analysis of the court‚Äôs records, focused on the magistrates‚Äô professional practices‚Äîhow they investigated, interrogated, tortured, and sentenced litigants while at the same time translating social and political conflicts into legal statements of fact, demonstrates that the mutually constitutive relationship between ideals of justice and everyday judicial practices, was at the core of a judicial epistemology which, situated between facts and faith, calls for a revision of our understanding of the political role of those courts, and beyond, of our understanding of early-modern political culture.

This foodborne pathogen is known to cause listeriosis, a serious invasive disease that particularly affects susceptible populations including immunocompromised individuals, newborns, pregnant women, and elderly people. New approaches for prevention and treatment of listeriosis require better understanding of mechanisms that enable L. monocytogenes to survive and thrive under a wide range of environmental conditions. One key regulatory mechanism of this Gram-positive bacterium involves the differential expression of different sets of genes by alternative sigma factors. In these studies, we employed next-generation sequencing tools to explore the regulatory network controlled by two alternative sigma factors, œÉB and œÉH. Specifically, our studies focused on (i) the regulatory roles of œÉB and œÉH, in the absence of other alternative sigma factors, (ii) the contribution of œÉB regulon members in important biological processes, and (iii) the development of a new transposon sequencing tool in L. monocytogenes. Our RNA sequencing data indicate that œÉH regulates a number of competence genes; We also found that in addition to stress response and virulence, œÉB has a broad role of resilience. For instance, œÉB regulates the metabolism of macronutrients and micronutrients to succeed in the intracellular environment where many nutrients are limited. Lastly, we designed a vector for a new transposon delivery system in L. monocytogenes. Overall, these findings provide a more complete picture of the regulatory network in L. monocytogenes.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:05Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 2

A modern tourist can descend into the catacombs much like an ancient visitor would have, allowing today‚Äôs visitor a shared experience with the past. Because Hypogeum I of the site is known primarily for its mixture of Egyptian, Greek, and Roman decorative elements, scholarship on the site is primarily descriptive, focusing on the visual components of the site that show evidence for cultural mixing or ‚Äúhybridity‚Äù. A multi-sensorial approach, however, has yet to be taken. Due to its relatively well-preserved nature, as well as the lack of written evidence at this site, I argue that we can use a phenomenologically-oriented methodology to gain insight on ancient visitor experience, ultimately discovering that ancient visitors would have seen the descent into the catacombs as a descent into the underworld.

In the first two chapters of my dissertation, I examine literature that engages with forced disappearances in Central America during the late twentieth century civil wars. I pay particular attention to two interrelated concepts that frame encounters with missing bodies: failure and recovery. On the one hand, I argue that Eurocentric understandings of failure, as articulated by legal discourses and capitalist notions of progress, pathologize Central America as region over determined by social and political incompetence necessitating Western intervention. Drawing on Anibal Quijano‚Äôs theoretical term, ‚Äúcoloniality of power,‚Äù I further claim that the discursive relationship between failure and recovery naturalizes the imperial drive of U.S. Empire expansion because the Third World is narrated as a space of negation that is always already threatening the development of democratic principles. On the other hand, Latino/a/x exile and diasporic literatures can shift this rhetoric of Empire by articulating a failure that exposes the enabling violence of Western intervention. Recovery is not the project of nation-states, but rather a set of practices that express a relationship to historical breaks, missing bodies, and archival silences in an effort to rescript narratives of belonging rather than envision a path to reform. 
	In the last two chapters, I consider literary and visual culture that engages with missing migrants traversing two borderlands: Mexico‚Äôs Southern border and the U.S./Mexico desert. As borderland sex work flourishes in Mexico‚Äôs Southern border, gendered violence is produced by state policies that deprive displaced people of their legal rights and instantiate a politics of valuation that generates psychological abuse and manipulation. Thus, I argue that Regina Galindo‚Äôs performance art, and Claudia Hernandez‚Äôs collection of short stories, De fronteras, denormalize state violence by staging a spectacle of death, mourning, and abjection as collective experiences. Conversely, my analysis of digital civil disobedience as enacted by the Electronic Disturbance Theatre maps a decolonial practice of relationality. Using GPS technology, the collective repurposed a cell phone in 2007 that poeticized the Sonoran desert landscape in order to lead lost migrants to water caches. The intention was to deploy an ‚Äúaesthetics of sustenance‚Äù that transform the status of migrants from opaque bodies devoid of legal personhood to translucent figures.

Present Junctures reads works of contemporary world literature that figure these boundaries between who is and who is not considered ‚Äúcontemporary.‚Äù Reading works by writers as diverse as Geoff Dyer, J.M. Coetzee, Maryse Cond√©, Edouard Lev√©, and Ivan Vladislaviƒá, it argues that the literary work of de-limiting the now is structurally analogous to the work of translation. Just as translators merge literary cultures by producing translated texts, each framing of the present generates intercultural links. And just as translation is unidirectional and asymmetrical, producing a text first and foremost for a target readership, making the originating context available in an altered form, and not the other way around, so is contemporaneity a determination of relevance and urgency for the benefit of a limited receiving context. The four chapters of Present Junctures illustrate different critical aspects of contemporaneity, showing it to be generative, limited by opacity, provisional, and secular. Each chapter also explores a different scale of worldliness at which contemporary world literature attempts to operate: the world city, the trans-national, the inter-national, and the global.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:06Z (GMT).

The dissertation shows how a persistent pattern of militant liberalism came to structure the postwar international order‚Äîone where the United States engages in militant action to protect the liberal international order from irredeemable illiberal threats, precisely when its hegemonic influence reaches its limit. While anti-totalitarianism and the war on terror are defining episodes in the development of this pattern, the dissertation argues that it was only liberalism‚Äôs encounter with decolonization that made the practice of militant liberalism ideologically coherent and enduring. After shattering the civilizational justifications of nineteenth century liberalism, decolonization provided militant liberals with a unique enemy, the Third World, upon which to distinguish and legitimate their own logic of violence, all while destroying alternative political possibilities arising out of the decolonial process.
The dissertation explores these themes through four political thinkers‚ÄîIsaiah Berlin, Louis Henkin, Frantz Fanon, and Carl Schmitt‚Äîand narrates a story about the legitimation of militant liberalism and the eventual rise of its discontents. On the one hand, Berlin and Henkin spoke of Thirdworldism as uniquely threatening: the former arguing that Thirdworldist nationalism often morphed into romantic self-assertion, and the latter claiming that Thirdworldists exploited state sovereignty allowing international terrorism to proliferate unbound. In response to these images, Berlin cast liberal violence as universal, ethically responsible, and hence morally superior to nationalist-inspired violence, while Henkin sympathized with US attempts to interpretively modify international law and drape itself under its authority as it hunted terrorists behind sovereign lines. On the other hand, Fanon and Schmitt, as critics of liberalism, challenged these pictures. The actors arising out of decolonization, they claimed, were neither driven by romantic self-assertion nor were they meaningfully sovereign. Instead, the authoritarian disasters and aggressive reactions of decolonization often stemmed from the interventions of militant liberalism and the aggravations of the liberal order itself. The prior accounts of decolonization disavowed liberalism‚Äôs complicity in fomenting the conditions that allowed it discontents to proliferate: global terrorism as the diametric force perpetuating endless warfare."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:21Z (GMT).

I argue that representations of copulation, female nudes, and amorous couples produced in and around the Shi'a Muslim court of northern India (Avadh) from 1754 to 1857 created a universe of affect and relationality. This world owes much to the philosophical, literary, and sensorial values of the native rulers and is at variance with the narratives advanced by encroaching British colonialism. The ethical and aesthetic depth of Avadhi art and architecture has, as a result of colonial classifications, been understudied and viewed simply as decadent and unoriginal. Moreover, paintings from Avadh have faded into art historical obscurity since they challenge what constitutes a canonical image and archive for various disciplines. By studying the visual history of the Avadhi court with reference to literature and ethics, I urge the disciplines of art history and social and cultural analysis to broadly rethink the ways in which a transference of political authority occurs in the interstices of empire.   My source materials include miniature paintings, illuminated manuscripts, Urdu and Persian poetry, short stories, royal autobiographies, and musical treatises. By studying the images and texts as imbricated rather than as discrete and hermetic genres and practices, I map Indo-Persianate sensibilities of religion, ethics, and politics across media. This approach to the study of Avadhi art also attends to its subsequent reception and circulation in India and in Western institutional frameworks such as museums and auction houses.  My work addresses broader questions of orientalism, colonialism, and the power of representation. How, for example, does erotica enforce the oriental despot paradigm of decline and decay? And how can this very material be used to unravel it? Genres, I argue, provide important insights since Avadhi miniatures, whose compositions represent in some form or another sexual arousal, were in the eighteenth century part of literary, poetic, and visual book genres.		5/27/23	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:05Z (GMT).

political network in south-central Crete known as a ‚ÄúGreat Minoan Triangle.‚Äù The theory, first published in 1985, concerns the political and economic relationships between the three largest known sites in the region: Phaistos, Agia Triada, and Kommos. The Triangle system proposes a mutually beneficial relationship between the three sites throughout the entire Minoan period, and perhaps even earlier. However, definitive attributes of the Triangle are scarce, which complicates its application to an understanding of the Early and Middle Minoan periods. This thesis examines the Triangle through the consideration of contemporary theoretical approaches to systems modeling during the 1960s‚Äì1980s, to evaluate the scholarly framework out of which the system emerged. A comprehensive analysis of the Triangle and its nuances allows for the rethinking of the theory as a whole, through the lens of recent studies in spatial technologies."

theory in the Hilbert space L2(R+) of the C0-semigroup P and its adjoint bP having
as generator, respectively, the Caputo and the right-sided Riemann-Liouville
fractional derivatives of index 1 < alpha < 2. These linear operators, which are nonlocal
and non-self-adjoint, appear in many recent studies in applied mathematics
and also arise as the infinitesimal generators of some substantial processes
such as the reflected spectrally negative alpha-stable process. We establish an intertwining
relationship between these semigroups and the semigroup of a Bessel
type process which is self-adjoint. Relying on this commutation identity, we
characterize the spectrum and the (weak) eigenfunctions and provide the spectral 
expansions of these semigroups on (at least) a dense subset of L2(R+). We
also obtain an integral representation of their transition kernels that enables to
derive regularity properties.
Inspired by this development, we further exploit, in the second part of this
dissertation, the concept of intertwining between general Markov semigroups.
More specifically, we start by showing that the intertwining relationship between
two minimal Markov semigroups acting on Hilbert spaces implies that
any recurrent extensions, in the sense of It ÀÜ o, of these semigroups satisfy the
same intertwining identity. Under mild additional assumptions on the intertwining
operator, we prove that the converse also holds. This connection enables
us to give an interesting probabilistic interpretation of intertwining relationships
between Markov semigroups via excursion theory: two such recurrent
extensions that intertwine share, under an appropriate normalization, the same
local time at the boundary point. Moreover, in the case when one of the (nonself-
adjoint) semigroup intertwines with the one of a quasi-diffusion, we obtain
an extension of Krein‚Äôs theory of strings by showing that its densely defined
spectral measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the measure appearing
in the Stieltjes representation of the Laplace exponent of the inverse local
time. Finally, we illustrate our results with the class of positive self-similar
Markov semigroups and also the reflected generalized Laguerre semigroups.
For the latter, we obtain their spectral decomposition and provide, under some
conditions, a perturbed spectral gap estimate for its convergence to equilibrium.
The third part of this dissertation is devoted to the applications of some of
these theoretical results to some substantial problems arising in financial mathematics.
Keeping in mind the fundamental theorem of asset pricing, we suggest
several transformations on a tractable and flexible Markov process (or equivalently,
its respective semigroup) in order that the discounted transformed process
becomes a (local) martingale while still keeping its tractability. In particular,
we suggest using an intertwining approach and/or Bochner‚Äôs subordination
(random time-change via a subordinator) to achieve this goal. Moreover,
in order to illustrate our approach, we discuss in details several examples that
include the class of L¬¥evy, self-similar and generalized CIR processes that reveal
the usefulness of our result. Furthermore, we provide for the non-self-adjoint
pricing semigroups associated to the latter family of processes a spectral expansions
on which we carry out some numerical analysis."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:22Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The over-arching theme is to examine natural and/or anthropogenic perturbations in species dynamics. This dissertation also extends the association of species dynamics in perturbed systems to fisher based economies and human-health. Given the spatial and temporal nature of biological systems, spatial models and spatial-temporal models are applied to understand system dynamics with environmental stochasticity as a key determinant. An integrated nested laplace approximation spatial-temporal model explains fisheries abundance, (2) spatial bionomic models identify optimal management strategies in a changing fishery, (3) conditional auto-regressive models explain spatial differences in fisher well-being. This thesis will test whether distribution of the summer flounder can be explained by regional climate driven increase in ocean temperature in the Mid-Altantic Bight, USA; develops three models calibrated to the Maine, USA green sea urchin fishery since 1995, that is used to test whether periodic closures are optimal to permit stock regeneration, or whether the creation of a marine reserve is optimal; provide empirical evidence to demonstrate a relationship between malnutrition in artisanal fisher communities an degradation in coral reef ecosystems in Indonesia. The results suggest that all management decisions take into consideration a precautionary approach that account for stochastic environmental events. Local sources of anthropogenic stressors should be mitigated, given that regional policies have a higher chance of ameliorating and off-setting global climate change stressors.

In the first two chapters of my dissertation, I examine literature that engages with forced disappearances in Central America during the late twentieth century civil wars. I pay particular attention to two interrelated concepts that frame encounters with missing bodies: failure and recovery. On the one hand, I argue that Eurocentric understandings of failure, as articulated by legal discourses and capitalist notions of progress, pathologize Central America as region over determined by social and political incompetence necessitating Western intervention. Drawing on Anibal Quijano‚Äôs theoretical term, ‚Äúcoloniality of power,‚Äù I further claim that the discursive relationship between failure and recovery naturalizes the imperial drive of U.S. Empire expansion because the Third World is narrated as a space of negation that is always already threatening the development of democratic principles. On the other hand, Latino/a/x exile and diasporic literatures can shift this rhetoric of Empire by articulating a failure that exposes the enabling violence of Western intervention. Recovery is not the project of nation-states, but rather a set of practices that express a relationship to historical breaks, missing bodies, and archival silences in an effort to rescript narratives of belonging rather than envision a path to reform. 
	In the last two chapters, I consider literary and visual culture that engages with missing migrants traversing two borderlands: Mexico‚Äôs Southern border and the U.S./Mexico desert. As borderland sex work flourishes in Mexico‚Äôs Southern border, gendered violence is produced by state policies that deprive displaced people of their legal rights and instantiate a politics of valuation that generates psychological abuse and manipulation. Thus, I argue that Regina Galindo‚Äôs performance art, and Claudia Hernandez‚Äôs collection of short stories, De fronteras, denormalize state violence by staging a spectacle of death, mourning, and abjection as collective experiences. Conversely, my analysis of digital civil disobedience as enacted by the Electronic Disturbance Theatre maps a decolonial practice of relationality. Using GPS technology, the collective repurposed a cell phone in 2007 that poeticized the Sonoran desert landscape in order to lead lost migrants to water caches. The intention was to deploy an ‚Äúaesthetics of sustenance‚Äù that transform the status of migrants from opaque bodies devoid of legal personhood to translucent figures. If the purpose of recovery is to enact a return to normative states of being or belonging, and if the historical violence of border crossing and forced migrations precludes such promises of return, the Transborder Immigrant Tool remaps the lost migrant and his/her personhood unto a landscape of possibility."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:24Z (GMT).

The environmental engineering goal of carbon sequestration is to prevent further increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration levels. This dissertation examines three aspects of carbon sequestration pertaining to the fluid dynamics of injection and post-injection within the geologic subsurface.
First, a time dependent injection strategy of brine alternating with CO2 is proposed as a method to reduce the CO2 mobility by increasing the rates of residual trapping and dissolution. After making some assumptions, the equations governing the dynamics of CO2 mass transport become a coupled set of 1D wave equations, whose wave speeds provide insight into the relative permeability conditions required for this injection strategy to be most effective. Numerical solutions using the method of characteristics are then compared against 3D TOUGH2 simulations and comparable favorably to one another. Both models predict that alternating brine injection can reduce the mass fraction of mobile CO2 to less than 10% using a volume ratio brine:CO2 of less than 2.75 and on time scales that are 100 ‚Äì 10,000 times faster than would occur with a continuous injection of CO2.
Second, the stability of residually trapped CO2 is analyzed with respect to its susceptibility to become remobilized. Here, a reservoir containing a region of homogeneously dispersed pockets of residually trapped CO2 is considered. Should the pore pressure decrease, the CO2 will expand, remobilize, rise within the domain, and potentially spread along the caprock of the formation. The dynamics of this process are predicted using two different relative permeability models: Brooks-Corey, and a modified Brooks-Corey that incorporates percolation theory. Experimental data justifying this latter model is presented. More importantly, the time scales of remobilized CO2 motion are shown to be vastly different for these two models and suggest the need for further experimental data.
Finally, as dry CO2 is injected into brine occupied reservoirs, there exists the potential for mechanical tension forces to be generated within the brine which can cause cavitation to occur. These cavitation dynamics are modeled here using explicit and averaged equations and compared to experimental data from drying an idealized synthetic heterogeneous porous media."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:09Z (GMT).

I revisit the period of agro-chemical agricultural intensification, known as the ‚ÄúGreen Revolution‚Äô since the 1960s, through subjective histories of the transformation of agrarian work that are inflected through the lived experiences of the present. Punjabi farmers, once perceived as the favoured beneficiaries of state-led development practices are now in the midst of a social and ecological crisis with falling incomes, high levels of indebtedness, frequent crop failures, polluted environment and increasing incidence of diseases. Using qualitative methods, I examine how this experience of precariousness and downward mobility among capitalist farmers has fostered an alternative imaginary that seeks to revalue agrarian work and enact sustainable agroecological farming, as well as the constraints on the realisation of this imaginary. For Punjabi farmers, the struggle is not one of preservation but of forging new practices of food production and consumption in a degraded material and social landscape. While sustainable agroecological farming is incipient and much less vibrant than in many other regions of India, it is precisely its emergence in Punjab that is instructive for understanding the exclusions structured through postcolonial developmental politics. The Green Revolution exemplifies the spatial, temporal and social displacement of ecological costs through regional division of labour, and through in-situ capitalist transformation of agrarian work. I argue that this historically situated prefigurative mobilisation, its ongoing internal negotiations and structural limitations, is a critical vantage point for understanding the political implications of the unevenness of postcolonial development practices.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:10Z (GMT).

Porous scaffolds from block copolymer self-assembled morphologies have a plethora of applications in areas including energy, filtration, and photonic devices. Selectively etching methods to remove one block are typically used to achieve porous structures derived from BCP equilibrium morphologies. BCP directed additive co-assembly, facilitated by thermal or solvent-vapor annealing processes and followed by BCP removal, is also routinely employed to achieve porous structures composed of non-BCP materials. 	In the first part of this thesis, fabrication and characterization of three dimensional (3D) gyroidal mesoporous thin films are discussed made from BCP-resin/carbon composites. Spin-coated films made from triblock terpolymer plus pre-carbon precursors were subjected to solvent vapor annealing (SVA) to reach the desired gyroidal equilibrium morphology. In situ grazing incidence small angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS) was employed to elucidate structure evolution at different swelling stages during SVA and to identify appropriate conditions to quench films into the gyroid structure at room temperature. After crosslinking of carbon precursors and thermal decomposition of the BCP, a carbon scaffold with gyroid morphology was formed. Such 3D gyroidal thin films have multiple advantages over conventional templates. They have high temperature resistance up to 900 ¬∞C under non-oxidizing conditions, which makes them compatible with deposition processes such as chemical vapor deposition.  3D pore size and hydrophilicity are tunable, facilitating the deposition of different types of materials into the nano-scale pores. Finally, a transfer technique for such gyroidal mesoporous thin films was developed to eliminate restrictions of film formation to specific substrates. These gyroidal carbon mesoporous thin film templates largely expand the materials selection pool for gyroidal structures. 	BCPs not only provide 3D scaffolds from equilibrium morphologies, but also can form 3D hierarchical superstructures with graded meso- to macro-scale pores from non-equilibrium processes. Resulting membranes have uniform surface mesopores supported by a graded macroporous sublayer. The process to generate such asymmetric ultrafiltration membranes is termed self-assembly plus non-solvent induced phase separation, or simply SNIPS. SNIPS membrane performance is largely controlled by details of the meso- and macro-porous structures. In the second part of this thesis, BCP derived SNIPS membrane ultrafiltration performance with respect to flux and solute diffusion rates is studied in relation to surface mesoporous and sublayer macroporous structures. These structures are systematically tuned identifying several key factors in the membrane casting process. To explore SNIPS membrane pore surface functionality, a new BCP membranes was designed and synthesized with thiol functional groups exposed on pore walls and membrane surfaces. A series of experiments were conducted to illustrate the accessibility of these functional groups after membrane fabrication. Conjugation reactions between maleimide functionalized dye and thiol membrane demonstrated that the thiol functional groups were active as covalent binding sites when simply soaking the membranes into target molecule solutions. We expect these functional membranes to enable biosensing and multi-level responsive smart materials applications."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:07Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

I examine the shape and significance of discourses and representations of corporal punishment across various modes of ecclesiastical, royal, and monastic governance. I contextualize these discourses within contemporary understandings of power as a shared moral ministry as explored by scholars like Mayke De Jong. Within this concept of political power as a shared ministry, I argue that Carolingian corporal punishment was a communicative, symbolic that use the body of the condemned to express authority in a concrete sense. Physical punishment both materialized abstract discourses abstract about the responsibilities and prerogatives of official authority and provided ruling elites with a means to make this power visible to and felt by non-elites. Drawing upon the work of penal historians and theorists like Michel Foucault, Guy Gelter, and Philip Smith, I understand physical punishment as a multivalent phenomenon which performs various social and cultural functions. Disciplinary violence and the punitive alteration of the body functioned as a public spectacle which indexes an offender‚Äôs transgressive otherness through her or his punished body while making visible and repairing a society‚Äôs normative boundaries. In the early Middle Ages, these punitive spectacles further drew upon close cultural associations between personal honor and parts of the human body such as the skin, hair, and face in order to conspicuously shame and humiliate. I further contend that in Carolingian thought and normative practice, the spectacular dimensions of corporal punishment were influenced by and at odds with contemporary understandings of punishment, drawn from religious and monastic discourses, as a personally curative and didactic phenomenon. I ultimately argue that the interactions and tensions between these two modes reveal a shared Carolingian punitive imaginary through which ruling elites conceived of ways in which power and authority could be physically felt and expressed through the bodies of offenders against the moral order they saw themselves as responsible for enforcing.		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:07Z (GMT).

Some argue that ILMs have become an outdated HR strategy because the use of ILMs may inhibit the firms‚Äô capabilities to adapt to the changing environments. In this paper, I challenge that conventional wisdom and propose that ILMs have the potential to enhance a firm‚Äôs adaptability to uncertain environments by facilitating its knowledge creation process. Drawing on panel data from 271 manufacturing firms, this study demonstrates that firms making greater use of ILMs in competitive industries exhibit more effective implementation of organizational learning practices ‚Äì leading to higher knowledge creation.		12/20/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:22Z (GMT).

Locally, Sicilian nobility negotiated each of these claims in a variety of ways. My focus on the Chiaramonte family and their patronage of art and architecture, especially at the Palazzo Chiaramonte-Steri, demonstrates how commissions operated as a key tactic of gaining visibility and legitimacy in the face of continual upheaval. The dissertation unfolds in two sections proceeded by a comprehensive introduction to the monument and the Chiaramonte family: in the first section, composed of three chapters, I focus on the tradition of painted ceilings in Sicily and treat at length the painted beamed ceiling of the Palazzo Chiaramonte-Steri‚Äôs reception room, the so-called Sala Magna. The second part of the project, divided into two chapters, investigates the Chiaramonte family's involvement in rehabilitating Sicily‚Äôs reputation in light of its challenged religious status.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:12Z (GMT).

While scholars have acknowledged the dramatic nature of Anglo-Saxon literature, comparatively few have studied how medieval readers brought the concept of public performance into the private sphere as they read. Even though patristic and early medieval authors were wary of drama‚Äôs ability to move and affect audiences, I argue in the following chapters that these same writers co-opted drama and theatrical spectacle in their own writing, hoping to use the affective power of performance to further instill Christian doctrine within the greater community. My project therefore accounts for the proliferation of performative cues in early medieval texts by examining how authors urged their readers to develop a deep sense of interiority through the use of dialogue, graphic imagery, dramatic figura, and the division of the psyche into distinct characters. This project thus ultimately traces how performative cues within devotional literature turn the medieval reader‚Äôs encounter with the silent page into a vibrant inner performance. 
Chapter One begins with King Alfred‚Äôs use of dialogue in his translation of Augustine‚Äôs Soliloquies. By dramatizing this internal dialogue through pointed questions and extended metaphors, I argue that the author uses the soliloquy form to script the creation of a dramatic ‚Äòself‚Äô. While the Soliloquies rely on dialogue to affect readers, the Old English Psychomachia in Chapter Two depends on the interaction between narrative and manuscript illumination to facilitate active reading and self-care. The poem‚Äôs battles are not simple grotesquerie, but rather eye-catching foci that produce affective responses in medieval readers. Chapter Three turns to the devotional power of the homily by examining dramatic dialogue in Vercelli IV. Like Alfred‚Äôs Soliloquies, the soul and the body function as protagonist and antagonist, turning the narrative into proto-morality play designed to scare participants into repentance. The Mind On-Stage concludes in Chapter Four with a reading of the Dream of the Rood‚Äîthe Cross‚Äôs vision, filled as it is with precise detail and description, invites readers to visualize and re-enact the Crucifixion scene within their minds. The act of re-reading the poem and visualizing the vision in turn requires readers to become part of a discursive devotional loop that demands continual prayer, meditation, and rumination."

Contour mode resonators are a potential technology for next generation filtering to replace current bulk acoustic wave (BAW) solutions. The lithographically defined center frequencies of contour mode resonators facilitate monolithic integration of multiple frequencies on a single chip, ideal for filter bank applications. Despite these advantages, contour mode resonator technology has not seen widespread use in commercial or military applications, with one of the main obstacles towards this end being spurious mode. Frequently, designs optimally exciting an intended mode will often excite many other modes. This can affect important performance metrics, such as the passband roll-off and group delay of filters created from these resonators, and potentially exposes the radio system to damaging high power signals. Part of the reason spurious modes remain a challenge is the lack of a rapid and wide-band simulation technique. Piezoelectric resonators typically have complex responses that must be modeled using finite element analysis (FEA) for accuracy. Conventionally, a Multiphysics harmonic analysis is run to model resonators. These simulations can take hours to days to complete. Trades must be made between frequency spacing and bandwidth for the simulation to complete in a reasonable amount of time, and can possibly miss modes. Due to the time limitations, designers often run 2D simulations which complete much faster, but will miss any out-of-plane information. To address these challenges, the wide-band Rapid Analytical-FEA Technique (RAFT) has been developed using software commonly found in research laboratories. The RAFT combines the speed of analytical analysis with the accuracy of FEA for full 3D solutions that complete orders of magnitude faster than conventional harmonic analysis while accurately modeling relevant modes. This enhanced speed is enabled by generalized expressions for the motional parameters of the modified Butterworth van-Dyke equivalent circuit: the motional resistance (Rm), inductance (Lm), and capacitance (Cm). Information from separate mechanical modal analysis and electrostatic analysis are entered into these expressions, and the frequency response is then simulated in analytical software. This accounts for the effect of all modes in the simulation bandwidth. This method is shown to improve simulations speeds by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, the RAFT enables new uses of FEA for design and analysis. Wide band simulations to assess the resonator performance far from resonance are now possible. Accurate parametric device exploration to investigate mode scaling and behavior to higher frequencies can be undertaken. The reduced simulation duration frees time for researchers to conduct studies of other critical device variables, such as the simulations of fabrication non-idealities, including electrode misalignment or sidewall angles. These effects are often not simulated due to time constraints. Thermal effects on frequency may be included to generate frequency-temperature curves for each mode‚Äôs unique response to temperature variations.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:08Z (GMT).

Problems with establishment may be overcome by interseeding, where cover crops are seeded between rows of cash crops prior to harvest. Interseeded cover crops can provide greater ecosystem services than cover crops established after harvest, including erosion control and weed suppression. In addition to these services, interseeded cover crops might also provide habitat for invertebrate seed predators such as carabid beetles and crickets, which feed on weed seeds. We established a field experiment to investigate how cash crop planting density affects interseeded cover crop performance during the transition to certified organic production. We measured corn density, light transmission through the corn canopy, cover crop and weed biomass, and corn grain yield.  We analyzed the relationship between these factors with regression, mixed models, path analysis, and partial correlation. The effect of corn density on interseeded cover crop biomass was significant when quantified both directly and indirectly as mediated by light transmission and weed biomass. At the October sample date, weed biomass was 31% lower in plots with interseeded cover crops than plots without, and corn grain yield was not different between plots with interseeded cover crops and plots without. We also conducted a laboratory experiment to explore the potential for cover crop seeds to be eaten by weed seed predators. Using four common invertebrate weed seed predators and a series of No Choice and Choice feeding assays, we presented seeds of ten cover crop species and three weed species to individual carabid beetles and crickets. We analyzed No Choice preference with logistic regression and Choice with Vanderploeg and Scavia‚Äôs electivity index and mixed models. We found that all four invertebrate seed predators consumed cover crop seeds and that preference varied by plant species and insect species. Overall results show that cover crop interseeding can be used to overcome one of the primary barriers to cover crop adoption and provide ecosystem services, but that cover crop seeds are susceptible to seed predation and thus cover crop species selection and seeding method are important to consider.

As a result,  sustainable eco-friendly hydropower reservoir operation is a priority to preserve downstream biodiversity while minimizing the impact on energy production levels. This study develops Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) and Sample Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SSDP) optimization models to address minimum environmental flow constraints on hydropower operations levels and storage targets while reflecting the uncertainty in future inflow forecasts. A case study of the Bosunggang Hydropower system in Korea compares the performance of historical operations with decisions generated by SDP and SSDP models with different hydrologic state variables, state variable discretization, and system turbine capacities. A watershed model, SSARR, was successfully employed to obtain a daily soil moisture series representing the watershed‚Äôs wetness. Importantly, simply adopting sophisticated optimization models without careful consideration of system characteristics such as basin hydrology and system objective does not guarantee better optimized system performance.		12/20/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:14Z (GMT).

Whilst different tactics are implemented to reduce food waste among the industry and consumers, changes in production and distribution methods change the sources and degree of risk. Understanding and identifying risk factors that might be introduced through changes, such as product handling and pattern of use, are needed to ensure food safety. The use of outgraded produce (i.e., visually unacceptable for the market) and the proposal of ignoring shelf life date labels have gained attention as solutions to food waste in both the U.S. and Europe. This study suggests that outgraded produce with physical damage (i.e., open lesions) retains more pathogens following disinfection treatment compared to ones with physiological defects (i.e., wounds with intact surface). However, rapid growth of spoilage microbiota limits the shelf life of outgraded produce with physical damage, and thus makes the survival and growth of retained pathogens, during post-harvest storage, irrelevant to food safety. In contrast to whole fruits and vegetables, the growth of L. monocytogenes in physically damaged produce became problematic before consumers could detect the sensory deterioration on RTE foods under both strict and abuse refrigeration temperatures. Therefore, the quality deteriorations, such as off odor, sliminess and fungal growth, should not be used as fail-safe indicators considering shelf-life limitation for L. monocytogenes growth. This study addresses food safety concerns associated with waste reduction and provides a quantitative framework for the development of risk management decisions.

I revisit the period of agro-chemical agricultural intensification, known as the ‚ÄúGreen Revolution‚Äô since the 1960s, through subjective histories of the transformation of agrarian work that are inflected through the lived experiences of the present. Punjabi farmers, once perceived as the favoured beneficiaries of state-led development practices are now in the midst of a social and ecological crisis with falling incomes, high levels of indebtedness, frequent crop failures, polluted environment and increasing incidence of diseases. Using qualitative methods, I examine how this experience of precariousness and downward mobility among capitalist farmers has fostered an alternative imaginary that seeks to revalue agrarian work and enact sustainable agroecological farming, as well as the constraints on the realisation of this imaginary. For Punjabi farmers, the struggle is not one of preservation but of forging new practices of food production and consumption in a degraded material and social landscape. While sustainable agroecological farming is incipient and much less vibrant than in many other regions of India, it is precisely its emergence in Punjab that is instructive for understanding the exclusions structured through postcolonial developmental politics. The Green Revolution exemplifies the spatial, temporal and social displacement of ecological costs through regional division of labour, and through in-situ capitalist transformation of agrarian work. I argue that this historically situated prefigurative mobilisation, its ongoing internal negotiations and structural limitations, is a critical vantage point for understanding the political implications of the unevenness of postcolonial development practices.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:26Z (GMT).

Quantitative analyses of trace-level volatile compounds are routinely performed as an objective measure of flavor in foodstuffs and raw materials. Standard analytical methods based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) usually require 30-60 minutes/sample. This low throughput is poorly suited for several emerging directions in flavor research or process control which can potentially create thousands of samples, e.g. characterization of breeding populations, as well as characterization of raw materials. Ambient ionization (AI) techniques like DART-MS are much faster, but with the drawback of lower sensitivity/ selectivity. A sorbent-coated mesh was developed for the extraction and pre-concentration of volatiles (Solid Phase Mesh Enhanced Sorption from Headspace, SPMESH), which could then be analyzed by Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART)-MS. The SPMESH coating material was optimized for the extraction of odor-active volatiles in complex food matrices. In combination with high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), SPMESH-DART could obtain detection limits below sensory thresholds for a variety of compounds with olfactory relevance in food matrices. The new method was validated in grape macerates, exhibiting excellent agreement with established GC-MS methodology (r2‚â•0.90).  
In a separate study, the mechanism for evolution of hydrogen sulfide during storage of wines fermented on elemental sulfur was investigated. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is frequently found in faulted wines with sulfurous off-aromas. H2S is reported to increase during bottle storage of some wines, and the identity of all potential precursors responsible for this latent H2S is still not resolved. We have shown that elemental sulfur residues (S0) on grapes can not only produce H2S during fermentation, but also yield wine-soluble intermediates capable of generating more H2S during storage.

The first working curves printed at a liquid-liquid interface are presented and closely match those printed at liquid-solid interfaces. A model describing the curing behavior at a liquid-liquid interface is derived and suggests that print speeds up to 162 cm/hour are possible with a commercially available resin. Resin cure speeds of 159 cm/hr and prototype system print speeds of 81 cm/hr were demonstrated using liquid-liquid interface stereolithography. The suitability of various aqueous, organic, and fluorinated organic liquid subphases are evaluated based on UV transmission, environmental considerations, immiscibility, spreading behavior, density, and chemical compatibility with the resin. High quality single-layer prints can be produced on multiple subphases. Print quality decreases for 3D prints due to capillary effects at the interface. The trade-off between resin spreading and subphase wetting at the print interface is explored.		6/8/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:08Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The work in this thesis concerns 1) improved the mechanical design of the robots, 2) addition of heterogeneous building material, and 3) an extended algorithmic framework to use this material. In order to lower system cost and maintenance, the TERMES robot is redesigned for manufacturing in low-end 3D printers and the new drivetrain, including motor adapters and pulleys, is based on 3D printed components instead of machined aluminum. The work further extends the original system by enabling construction of 3D structures without added hardware complexity in the robots. To do this, we introduce a reusable, spring-loaded expandable brick which can be easily manufactured through one-step casting and which complies with the original robots and bricks. This thesis also introduces a decentralized construction algorithm that permits an arbitrary number of robots to build overhangs over convex cavities. To enable timely completion of large-scale structures, we also introduce a method by which to optimize the transition probabilities used by the robots to traverse the structure.		6/8/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:09Z (GMT).

As esports bridges across fan practices exhibited in popular communication, sociology of sports, leisure studies and video game studies, so too does this research project. Going from the media object, to fan communal practices, to individual fan practices, this research draws on a range of theories from framing, sports geography, and fan identity to better understand this emerging media form.  The nexus of all of these theories is to combine understanding fan practices with a grounded theory approach.
The central argument of this research is that, by elucidating these practices, scholars can better understand not only the emerging practices of fans but how they reflect core identities of the fans. Fans shape not only through our practices of fandom what it means as a communal activity, but how central the identity is to their own everyday lives. A backbone of fan identity is how gender is reflected back through the practice of being a fan. No matter the medium of the fan object itself, video games or other, a central component to our understanding of being a fan is how fan practices reflect gender stereotypes ‚Äì and esports is no exception.
To examine these arguments, I executed three studies using multiple methods. I used textual analysis, field observation, and personal interviews to analyze fans from a multitude of perspectives. Bringing these different methods together in the end, I reflect on our understanding of what it means to be a fan of not just esports but more broadly of entertainment mediums like sports. The theoretical implications suggest a need to update the scholarship‚Äôs understanding of sport and fandom. The practical applications are that, in this media rich world, we must better understand what fans do in everyday life."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:14Z (GMT).

also known as silent stroke since they do not illicit noticeable symptoms. Recently,
due to the development of various imaging modalities and aging population in the
western world, increasing number of CMBs are detected. Clinical studies have shown
that aging and hypertension significantly increases the chance of such bleeds and the
National Institute of Health recognizes CMBs as a major factor in Alzheimer disease
pathology. Independent events of CMBs are also a risk factor for subsequent larger
intracerebral hemorrhages, ischemic stroke, Binswager‚Äôs disease and Alzheimer‚Äôs
disease. However, studies in cellular level are lacking, partially due to inadequate
animal model that allow both detection and follow up analysis of such small bleeds.
We used tightly focused femtosecond laser pulses to injure single penetrating
arterioles in the cortex of live anesthetized rodents and used multi-photon excited
fluorescence imaging to quantify inflammatory responses over long periods of time.
The work presented in this dissertation provides comprehensive spatial and temporal
pathological consequences after micro scale hemorrhagic injury to a single blood

Some fault parameters of the earthquake, however, can only be estimated probabilistically for a future event. The bathymetry, on the other hand, is surveyed with an imperfect resolution and accuracy, which can lead to errors in the tsunami modeling results. Hence, tsunami assessments before an event are unavoidably uncertain. This thesis aims to describe how the uncertainties of some earthquake fault parameters and bathymetry impact the tsunami assessment uncertainties.
The earthquake uncertainties are related with the assumed aleatory nature of the slip distribution and the rupture location, while the bathymetry uncertainties are associated with the lack of data in unsurveyed areas. These uncertain inputs and the corresponding tsunami response are modeled as random elements by adopting a stochastic approach. The uncertain earthquakes of this thesis consider a slip distribution modeled as an homogeneous random field and a rupture location modeled as a random vector. The bathymetry, on the other hand, is modeled as a non-homogeneous Gaussian random field, which is conditional to surveyed data. The generation of samples of the earthquake rupture location is straightforward. Conversely, the generation of samples of the slip distribution and bathymetry are rather complex. By means of a Karhunen-Loeve expansion and a translation model we propose a consistent method for the generation of samples of these uncertain inputs. Unlike other approaches, the Karhunen Loeve expansion generates consistent and accurate samples of non-rectangular random fields. The uncertainties of tsunami hazard assessments are then quantified by means of a Stochastic Reduced Order Model (SROM), which is more accurate than the classic Monte Carlo simulation for a same number of samples.
The uncertainty quantification methods developed in this thesis are presented with two illustration cases. In one illustration case we study MW 8.0 earthquakes within a seismogenic region in North Chile. First, we demonstrate that our proposed method generates consistent earthquake and bathymetry samples. Second, we demonstrate that estimates of tsunami assessment uncertainties obtained with SROM are more accurate than estimates obtained with classic Monte Carlo simulations. From sensitivity analyses and comparison with records of the 2014 earthquake tsunami, we also conclude that the probability properties of the analyzed uncertain inputs and other aspects of the tsunami assessment can be relevant sources of uncertainty. In the second illustration case we perform a probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment (PTHA) which assesses earthquakes generated in the Manila Subduction Zone and tsunami responses in Hong Kong, China, and Kao Hsiung, Taiwan. First we demonstrate that our proposed methods can be combined with PTHA to account for the earthquake fault parameters and bathymetry uncertainties. Second, we demonstrate that the earthquakes recurrence model and the tsunami propagation model adopted in the PTHA constitute additional sources of uncertainty, which can be as relevant as the uncertainties of the earthquake fault parameters and bathymetry."

political network in south-central Crete known as a ‚ÄúGreat Minoan Triangle.‚Äù The theory, first published in 1985, concerns the political and economic relationships between the three largest known sites in the region: Phaistos, Agia Triada, and Kommos. The Triangle system proposes a mutually beneficial relationship between the three sites throughout the entire Minoan period, and perhaps even earlier. However, definitive attributes of the Triangle are scarce, which complicates its application to an understanding of the Early and Middle Minoan periods. This thesis examines the Triangle through the consideration of contemporary theoretical approaches to systems modeling during the 1960s‚Äì1980s, to evaluate the scholarly framework out of which the system emerged. A comprehensive analysis of the Triangle and its nuances allows for the rethinking of the theory as a whole, through the lens of recent studies in spatial technologies."

This paper reports on research conducted in the Machakos region of Kenya to understand the credit rationing status of smallholder households and the potential of a novel financial product, risk contingent credit (RCC), to open access to credit markets for households who may have previously voluntarily withdrawn from the credit markets. We find that households do not show a preference for RCC as compared to a normal credit offering, but that the intervention did lead to quantity and risk rationed households acting in a similar manner to the price rationed households. These findings highlight the importance of extending credit access to agricultural smallholders and point to the need for further research into RCC.

The environmental engineering goal of carbon sequestration is to prevent further increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration levels. This dissertation examines three aspects of carbon sequestration pertaining to the fluid dynamics of injection and post-injection within the geologic subsurface.
First, a time dependent injection strategy of brine alternating with CO2 is proposed as a method to reduce the CO2 mobility by increasing the rates of residual trapping and dissolution. After making some assumptions, the equations governing the dynamics of CO2 mass transport become a coupled set of 1D wave equations, whose wave speeds provide insight into the relative permeability conditions required for this injection strategy to be most effective. Numerical solutions using the method of characteristics are then compared against 3D TOUGH2 simulations and comparable favorably to one another. Both models predict that alternating brine injection can reduce the mass fraction of mobile CO2 to less than 10% using a volume ratio brine:CO2 of less than 2.75 and on time scales that are 100 ‚Äì 10,000 times faster than would occur with a continuous injection of CO2.
Second, the stability of residually trapped CO2 is analyzed with respect to its susceptibility to become remobilized. Here, a reservoir containing a region of homogeneously dispersed pockets of residually trapped CO2 is considered. Should the pore pressure decrease, the CO2 will expand, remobilize, rise within the domain, and potentially spread along the caprock of the formation. The dynamics of this process are predicted using two different relative permeability models: Brooks-Corey, and a modified Brooks-Corey that incorporates percolation theory. Experimental data justifying this latter model is presented. More importantly, the time scales of remobilized CO2 motion are shown to be vastly different for these two models and suggest the need for further experimental data.
Finally, as dry CO2 is injected into brine occupied reservoirs, there exists the potential for mechanical tension forces to be generated within the brine which can cause cavitation to occur. These cavitation dynamics are modeled here using explicit and averaged equations and compared to experimental data from drying an idealized synthetic heterogeneous porous media."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:26Z (GMT).

Thomas	2018-10-22T17:23:10Z			5/30/18		The design of next generation internal combustion engines will require a more detailed understanding of the dynamics of fuel combustion. One way of studying this combustion process is through computational simulations of fuel injection, break-up and combustion processes. However, currently no computational fluid dynamic code is capable of simulating this entire process. The key missing aspect in simulating the fuel combustion process is resolving the vaporization process. As combustion occurs in the gas phase, a liquid fuel must vaporize before combustion can occur. The current dissertation demonstrates a computational framework for simulating such a vaporizing flow. The framework is built from the ground up starting from the laws of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy combined with the relevant thermodynamic relations. The framework discussed in this work will have a few properties that make it suitable towards the goal of simulating vaporizing multiphase flows. First, the solver is verified to produce convergent solutions, regardless of the thermodynamic regime of vaporization. Second, the actual implementation of vaporization sources is unconditionally stable, making simulation practical at all mesh resolutions. Both of these properties are important for performing simulations of real combustion configurations. This dissertation also includes a study on simulating droplet-laden turbulent flows, and explores the impact of flow turbulence on vaporization.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:10Z (GMT).

Recent advances demonstrate that conveniently accessible parameters, including silica precursor chemistry, solvent, and reaction pH, can be used to tune particle size down to below 10 nm. By cooperative assembly of inorganic silica species and organic molecular structure directing agents, a diverse range of mesoporous silica nanoparticles with hexagonal, cubic, and multicompartment structures can be produced. This versatile chemistry provides pathways for answering fundamental questions about structure formation and developing novel functional nanomaterials for applications including separation, catalysis, and drug delivery. In this dissertation, two examples of such silica nanoparticle systems are discussed. 
As a first example, the development of an intensity-based fluorescent silica nanoparticle barcode is discussed. This work is motivated by a need for fluorescent tags that increase the number of molecular species that can be simultaneously labeled and reliably distinguished using commercially available fluorescence microscopes. In this study, the synthetic parameters that govern the incorporation of precisely controlled numbers of fluorescent dyes into silica nanoparticles in batch reactions are identified. Heterogeneities within particle batches are mapped using single particle fluorescence microscopy. Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate that fluorescent silica nanoparticles with well-separated high and low fluorescence intensity distribution levels can be synthesized in batch reactions and used as an intensity barcode in fluorescence microscopy.
In the second example, a mesoporous silica nanoparticle system, structure directed by surfactant-micelle self-assembly, is investigated. As a function of an added pore expander molecule or reaction stirring rate, a series of four distinct mesoporous silica nanoparticle structures is observed: hexagonal, cubic/hexagonal multicompartment, cubic, and dodecagonal quasicrystalline. The mechanism driving the structural transition between cubic crystalline and dodecagonal quasicrystalline mesoporous silica nanoparticles is investigated. Control of nanoparticle size down to a single tiling unit (< 30 nm), allows direct comparison between experimental results and a simple theoretical growth model, providing insights into the early growth trajectories of quasicrystalline mesoporous silica. This work identifies simple synthetic control parameters for quasicrystal growth that may be translated to other self-assembled systems."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:15Z (GMT).

Individuals are not only driven by independent incentives but also by social influence as well as social approval and recognition. This dissertation contains three papers concerning the role of peer effects and social status on individuals‚Äô behavior and well-being.
The first chapter analyzes adolescents peer effects on cigarettes consump- tion by considering the popularity (i.e., social network centrality measures) of smokers and non-smokers within high schools. The analysis is based on the Ad- dHealth dataset, which has exhaustive data on social networks in the sampled high schools and detailed information about students and household charac- teristics. We use variations across cohorts within schools by using school fixed effects, lagged peer‚Äôs behavior at the cohort level as well as instrumental vari- ables. We find that the popularity of smokers increases the probability of indi- viduals smoking, while the popularity of non-smokers has the opposite effect. Analogous results apply to the number of cigarettes smoked, as well as the age of initiation. These effects persist up to fourteen years after high school.
The second chapter follows a similar strategy to analyze peer effects on high school GPA. Using AddHealth data, we find that the popularity of good stu- dents in mathematics considerably increases individuals‚Äô math GPA the fol- lowing year, while the popularity of bad students has the opposite effect. The positive effect is somewhat stronger for males, yet the negative effect is much stronger for females. These patterns extend to college participation and com- pletion. Thus, the first two chapters of this dissertation show the importance of social status in mediating the strength of peers‚Äô influence. Individuals seem to ‚Äòfollow‚Äô the behavior of high-status individuals and avoid that of low-status individuals.
The final chapter looks at positional concerns in rural China with respect to rural income and remittances. More specifically, we look at how the average income and average remittances in the local county affect individuals‚Äô subjec- tive well-being (SWB). We find that average rural income has a strong negative effect on SWB, arguably due to income comparisons.

Locally, Sicilian nobility negotiated each of these claims in a variety of ways. My focus on the Chiaramonte family and their patronage of art and architecture, especially at the Palazzo Chiaramonte-Steri, demonstrates how commissions operated as a key tactic of gaining visibility and legitimacy in the face of continual upheaval. The dissertation unfolds in two sections proceeded by a comprehensive introduction to the monument and the Chiaramonte family: in the first section, composed of three chapters, I focus on the tradition of painted ceilings in Sicily and treat at length the painted beamed ceiling of the Palazzo Chiaramonte-Steri‚Äôs reception room, the so-called Sala Magna. The second part of the project, divided into two chapters, investigates the Chiaramonte family's involvement in rehabilitating Sicily‚Äôs reputation in light of its challenged religious status.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:28Z (GMT).

The topic of climate change poses new challenges for educators intent on not only informing audiences but informing in such a way that creates lasting impact. The purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate the extent to which extent climate change communication and environmental psychology research can influence environmental education practice. Interviews with educators from five climate change related professional development programs and networks revealed a high level of awareness of climate change communication and related research. Educators accessed research through a variety of means and reported both practice change and a sense of validation as a result of the research. They also reported some tension between practice knowledge and research-based knowledge. This work begins to fill a gap both in our understanding of how informal educators communicate about climate change and in how they use research in their practice.

Whilst different tactics are implemented to reduce food waste among the industry and consumers, changes in production and distribution methods change the sources and degree of risk. Understanding and identifying risk factors that might be introduced through changes, such as product handling and pattern of use, are needed to ensure food safety. The use of outgraded produce (i.e., visually unacceptable for the market) and the proposal of ignoring shelf life date labels have gained attention as solutions to food waste in both the U.S. and Europe. This study suggests that outgraded produce with physical damage (i.e., open lesions) retains more pathogens following disinfection treatment compared to ones with physiological defects (i.e., wounds with intact surface). However, rapid growth of spoilage microbiota limits the shelf life of outgraded produce with physical damage, and thus makes the survival and growth of retained pathogens, during post-harvest storage, irrelevant to food safety. In contrast to whole fruits and vegetables, the growth of L. monocytogenes in physically damaged produce became problematic before consumers could detect the sensory deterioration on RTE foods under both strict and abuse refrigeration temperatures. Therefore, the quality deteriorations, such as off odor, sliminess and fungal growth, should not be used as fail-safe indicators considering shelf-life limitation for L. monocytogenes growth. This study addresses food safety concerns associated with waste reduction and provides a quantitative framework for the development of risk management decisions.

The public school is a building unlike any other in the scope of its reach and impact as part of the built environment of a community. In cities, villages, and rural areas across the country, public schools are vital community anchors. Yet in New York State, these buildings do not have the protections that are offered other types of historic and culturally significant properties. The public schools of Auburn, New York state are part of a state-mandated system by which public funds are used to subsidize major capital projects and additions. This system of construction underwriting, combined with an inherently anti-preservation mindset, presents challenges to preserving and protecting active historic public school buildings. 
The purpose of this work is to provide a framework for school boards to think about how best to address the judicial, legal, and public perception challenges arrayed against the preservation of public school buildings. It illustrates the fallacy of the commonly held belief that newer school buildings produce higher student achievement and are therefore better. It reveals the way in which the current building aid structuring favors new construction projects and incentivizes the deferment of proper school maintenance. It suggests both general approaches and specific ways in which school districts like Auburn‚Äôs can help to protect its historic school buildings. It is hoped that the introduction of measures that encourage preservation of historic schools through proper maintenance will be supported by New York State‚Äôs Education Department."

While scholars have acknowledged the dramatic nature of Anglo-Saxon literature, comparatively few have studied how medieval readers brought the concept of public performance into the private sphere as they read. Even though patristic and early medieval authors were wary of drama‚Äôs ability to move and affect audiences, I argue in the following chapters that these same writers co-opted drama and theatrical spectacle in their own writing, hoping to use the affective power of performance to further instill Christian doctrine within the greater community. My project therefore accounts for the proliferation of performative cues in early medieval texts by examining how authors urged their readers to develop a deep sense of interiority through the use of dialogue, graphic imagery, dramatic figura, and the division of the psyche into distinct characters. This project thus ultimately traces how performative cues within devotional literature turn the medieval reader‚Äôs encounter with the silent page into a vibrant inner performance. 
Chapter One begins with King Alfred‚Äôs use of dialogue in his translation of Augustine‚Äôs Soliloquies. By dramatizing this internal dialogue through pointed questions and extended metaphors, I argue that the author uses the soliloquy form to script the creation of a dramatic ‚Äòself‚Äô. While the Soliloquies rely on dialogue to affect readers, the Old English Psychomachia in Chapter Two depends on the interaction between narrative and manuscript illumination to facilitate active reading and self-care. The poem‚Äôs battles are not simple grotesquerie, but rather eye-catching foci that produce affective responses in medieval readers. Chapter Three turns to the devotional power of the homily by examining dramatic dialogue in Vercelli IV. Like Alfred‚Äôs Soliloquies, the soul and the body function as protagonist and antagonist, turning the narrative into proto-morality play designed to scare participants into repentance. The Mind On-Stage concludes in Chapter Four with a reading of the Dream of the Rood‚Äîthe Cross‚Äôs vision, filled as it is with precise detail and description, invites readers to visualize and re-enact the Crucifixion scene within their minds. The act of re-reading the poem and visualizing the vision in turn requires readers to become part of a discursive devotional loop that demands continual prayer, meditation, and rumination."

The objective of this analysis was to examine the dietary correlates of vitamin B12 status in pregnant women participating in a prospective cohort study in Southern India.  Methods: Participants were 400 pregnant women (< 14 weeks gestation) enrolled in a cohort study. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated, interviewer-administered, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, which assessed dietary intake of 108 food items. Serum vitamin B12 was measured via electrochemiluminescence; vitamin deficiency was defined as vitamin B12  concentrations less than 148.0 pmol/L. Linear and binomial regression models were used to examine the associations between dietary variables (i.e., food groups, nutrients) and vitamin B12 status.  Results: The median daily vitamin B12 intake was 1.7 g (IQR: 1.1‚Äì2.5), and 63.3% of participants were vitamin B12 deficient. In food group analyses, consumption of egg-based foods, organ meats, red meat, and grams were associated with higher serum vitamin B12 concentrations; consumption of pulses and fruit-based foods were associated with lower vitamin B12 concentrations. Similarly, increased consumption of egg-based foods (RR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.98‚Äì0.99, p = 0.023), milk products (0.99, 0.99‚Äì0.99, p = 0.038), and total meat 0.80 (0.69‚Äì0.93, p = 0.004) were associated with significantly lower risk for vitamin B12 deficiency. In nutrient increased intake of vitamin B12; saturated (caprylic, capric, lauric, stearic), monounsaturated (palmitoleic), and polyunsaturated (linolenic, arachidonic, timnodonic, cervonic) fatty acids; cholesterol; iodine; and most amino acids (tryptophan, threonine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, cysteine, tyrosine, valine, alanine, aspartic acid, serine) were associated with higher serum vitamin B12 concentrations and lower risk for vitamin B12 deficiency (p < 0.05).  Conclusion: Vitamin B12 intake was low in this population and was associated with risk for vitamin B12 deficiency. Low consumption of animal-source foods (i.e., milk, egg, and meat products) was associated with risk for vitamin B12 deficiency. Assessing dietary intake during early pregnancy is important to identify risk factors for vitamin B12 deficiency and to inform dietary recommendations.

As a result,  sustainable eco-friendly hydropower reservoir operation is a priority to preserve downstream biodiversity while minimizing the impact on energy production levels. This study develops Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) and Sample Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SSDP) optimization models to address minimum environmental flow constraints on hydropower operations levels and storage targets while reflecting the uncertainty in future inflow forecasts. A case study of the Bosunggang Hydropower system in Korea compares the performance of historical operations with decisions generated by SDP and SSDP models with different hydrologic state variables, state variable discretization, and system turbine capacities. A watershed model, SSARR, was successfully employed to obtain a daily soil moisture series representing the watershed‚Äôs wetness. Importantly, simply adopting sophisticated optimization models without careful consideration of system characteristics such as basin hydrology and system objective does not guarantee better optimized system performance.		12/20/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:30Z (GMT).

McNulty, Tracy K.||Bosteels, Bruno||Levitt, Bruce A	2018-10-22T17:23:11Z			5/30/18		This dissertation argues for the singularity with which the theatre, conceived as a fleshly encounter with language, constitutes a matrix for social change in the age of global capitalism. The project traces a genealogy of French dramatists and theatre theorists who share in common an unprecedented deployment of the stage as a model for dialectical thought, which they also conceive of as integral to the question of human subjectivity. The dissertation demonstrates how the formal divisions which give the theatre its specificity ‚Äì its tension between dramatic text and the horizon of live performance, its mimetic and spatial disjunctions, its opposition of spectator and actor ‚Äì invariably lead practitioners and theorists to take a stand with respect to two orientations toward the subject. They are distinguished, I argue, by their different attitudes concerning the aleatory, unpredictable nature of live theatrical performance. The stakes of the project for theatre and performance studies lie in its affirmationist acount of theatrical mimesis. Far from constituting a site of representational closure and binary opposition to be deconstructed and overcome, I insist upon a reading of theatricality in terms of dialectical scission, in which the stage‚Äôs formal constraints provide the substrate for eruptions of the unthought within which change finds its bearings. By delineating two subjective orientations in theatre theory and practice, this dissertation marshals the stage‚Äôs formidable resources in a battle against the finitude that attends every relinking of dialectical division, and which grounds the ideological shadow play that sustains power in our current conjuncture. Running against the grain of those critical tendencies that would reduce the theatre to an irreparably metaphysical, and thus politically retrograde construct, this project asserts the necessity of the theatre and the singularity with which it is capable of orienting us in the confusion of our times.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:11Z (GMT).

DI pipelines account for 23% of U.S. water distribution systems (US.EPA, 2013), and have been used extensively for replacing aging cast iron (CI) pipelines.  Under earthquake-induced ground deformation a jointed DI pipeline is vulnerable primarily to joint pullout and excessive joint rotation.  Improvements in pipeline technology have led to the development of DI pipelines with restrained axial slip joints that move axially and rotate to conform to differential soil movements, but are restrained from pullout without leakage and loss of structural integrity. A series of large-scale experiments was performed on DI pipelines with restrained axial slip joints to characterize tensile strength properties, direct axial compression and tension, moment vs rotation characteristics, soil axial restraint, and performance in response to fault rupture.  Large-scale tests were performed primarily on 6-in. (150-mm)-diameter DI pipelines, but also included direct tension and bending tests on 12-in. (300-mm)-diameter DI pipelines.   The direct compression tests show either leakage or irrecoverable deformation in the form of large rotation at loads equal to or slightly higher than load consistent with the proportional limit stress of DI pipe.  The direct tension tests show that tensile failure of the pipeline depends on the locking mechanism of the joint.  Joints that use full circumferential locking rings generate the highest resisting force.  Failure and leakage under tension with these features occurred as DI ring shear fracture and bell fracture.  In contrast, joints that use locking segments mobilized lower pullout force.  Failure and leakage of joints with locking segments occurred as local deformation at the spigot caused by load concentration at the locking segments, allowing the weld bead to slip past the locking segments and cause leakage. Large-scale fault rupture tests provide a comprehensive and detailed understanding of the sequence of joint movements, combined axial pullout and rotation at each joint, and the actual axial forces influenced by longitudinal frictional resistance and axial resistance to movement at the joints.  The longitudinal frictional forces are controlled by at-rest (Ko) conditions, which set the initial state of stress along the pipeline near the north and south ends of the split basin, and the conditions of maximum lateral soil reaction during fault rupture, which establish the maximum longitudinal frictional resistance for the pipeline in the vicinity of fault rupture. The joint axial resistance model proposed in this work is obtained from the expression for face resistance of the leading edge of a jacked pipe proposed by Meskele and Stuedlein (2015) from the work of Weber and Hurtz (1981).  The model is used to predict the axial resistance from a restrained axial slip joint for DI pipe and the pullout restraints of PVCO and PVC pipelines.  The proposed model provides for relatively close prediction under Ko conditions within ¬±15% of the actual maximum load measured during full scale soil axial resistance tests.

Nevertheless, studies of Minoan Crete, as in other areas of the Bronze Age Mediterranean, fail to acknowledge this dual nature of food. Instead, most current scholarship on Minoan food is divided into two distinct camps: studies of subsistence focus on the nutritional qualities of food, and studies of feasting invoke its role in elite social organization. The result of this dichotomy is that while scholars have been able to list the ingredients in the typical Minoan‚Äôs diet and have been quick to identify sumptuous banquets at palaces, tombs, and religious sites, little attention is paid to the practices of cooking and eating in Minoan homes. This dissertation addresses this lacuna by analyzing the evidence of cuisine and dining etiquette at four Late Minoan IB domestic sites. Through a functional analysis of ceramic vessels and close examination of architectural layout, I investigate what kinds of foods were cooked, what cooking techniques were used, how diners interacted with the food and with each other, and how household layout reflected commensality behaviors. Furthermore, this study clarifies the political role of feasting in Neopalatial palaces by comparing the palace evidence to the general system of Minoan commensality gleaned from the case studies. I accomplish this goal by implementing a theoretical model that treats feasting as one end of a spectrum of food-sharing behaviors encompassing the most mundane to the most elaborate meals. Treating meals comparatively allows a closer understanding of the experience of the diners, who would have judged a meal‚Äôs value against all those they had eaten previously. Thus, I consider the intentions of the hosts and the messages received by the guests. As a result, my analysis of Minoan cuisine and reevaluation of palatial feasts sheds light on the functions of the palaces themselves, and the sociopolitical systems that they upheld through their banquets.

Quantitative analyses of trace-level volatile compounds are routinely performed as an objective measure of flavor in foodstuffs and raw materials. Standard analytical methods based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) usually require 30-60 minutes/sample. This low throughput is poorly suited for several emerging directions in flavor research or process control which can potentially create thousands of samples, e.g. characterization of breeding populations, as well as characterization of raw materials. Ambient ionization (AI) techniques like DART-MS are much faster, but with the drawback of lower sensitivity/ selectivity. A sorbent-coated mesh was developed for the extraction and pre-concentration of volatiles (Solid Phase Mesh Enhanced Sorption from Headspace, SPMESH), which could then be analyzed by Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART)-MS. The SPMESH coating material was optimized for the extraction of odor-active volatiles in complex food matrices. In combination with high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), SPMESH-DART could obtain detection limits below sensory thresholds for a variety of compounds with olfactory relevance in food matrices. The new method was validated in grape macerates, exhibiting excellent agreement with established GC-MS methodology (r2‚â•0.90).  
In a separate study, the mechanism for evolution of hydrogen sulfide during storage of wines fermented on elemental sulfur was investigated. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is frequently found in faulted wines with sulfurous off-aromas. H2S is reported to increase during bottle storage of some wines, and the identity of all potential precursors responsible for this latent H2S is still not resolved. We have shown that elemental sulfur residues (S0) on grapes can not only produce H2S during fermentation, but also yield wine-soluble intermediates capable of generating more H2S during storage. Through HPLC ‚Äì high resolution mass spectrometry, we identified H2S-releasing polythionates in the S0 fermented wine sample that are absent in the control, and propose a mechanism for the formation of a supplementary S0-derived source."

Direct quantitation of catalytic activity at the bimetallic interface is important for understanding the enhancement mechanism, but challenging experimentally. Using single-molecule super-resolution catalysis imaging in correlation with electron microscopy, we report the first quantitative visualization of enhanced bimetallic activity within single bimetallic nanoparticles. We focus on heteronuclear bimetallic PdAu nanoparticles that present a well-defined Pd-Au bimetallic interface in catalyzing a photo-driven fluorogenic disproportionation reaction. Our approach also enables a direct comparison between the bimetallic and monometallic regions within the same nanoparticle. Theoretical calculations further provide insights into the electronic nature of N‚ÄìO bond activation of the reactant (resazurin) adsorbed on bimetallic sites. Sub-particle activity correlation between bimetallic enhancement and monometallic activity suggests that the favorable locations to construct bimetallic sites are those monometallic sites with higher activity, leading to a strategy for making effective bimetallic nanocatalysts. The results highlight the power of super-resolution catalysis imaging in gaining insights that could help improve nanocatalysts.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:17Z (GMT).

Chapter one studies the inter-generational effects of maternal early childhood shocks on the human capital outcomes of children. I exploit the 1983-1985 Ethiopian famine as an exogenous source of variation to study the effects of exposure to severe shocks in utero and/ or during the first three years after birth on the cognitive, non-cognitive and health capabilities of children of mothers who were exposed to shocks in early childhood. Using data that track children from early childhood through adolescence, I estimate the effects of mothers' early childhood shock over their children's life cycle. I find that the famine had a lasting inter-generational effect. Mothers' early childhood famine exposure reduces their children's height-for-age z-score, schooling, locus of control and self-esteem. These effects are persistent from age one through early adolescence. The main inter-generational transmission channel of the shock is children's maternal human capital endowment. Mothers who suffered the famine in early childhood are shorter and have less schooling. I also find a critical maternal shock duration threshold of three months. These findings point to ineffectiveness of remediation once the damage is done to mothers as young girls. The policy implication is that girls under the age of three with high risk of crossing the critical famine duration threshold should be targeted for health and nutritional interventions. 
In chapter two, coauthored with Christopher B. Barrett, Erin Lentz and Birhanu Ayana, we estimate the causal effects of index insurance coverage on the subjective well-being (SWB) of a poor population in rural southern Ethiopia. Insurance coverage may be welfare enhancing ex ante by reducing exposure to risk. Yet, if the insurance policy lapses without payout, but having paid a premium, the buyer will be financially worse off and may experience buyer's remorse ex post of the resolution of uncertainty. The ex ante and ex post well-being effects of insurance may therefore differ, especially in the absence of indemnity payments. We separately identify (1) the ex ante SWB effects of current insurance coverage that arise from reducing ex ante risk exposure to potential shocks, and (2) the ex post buyer's remorse effects of lapsed insurance policies that did not pay out. By exploiting the randomization of incentives to purchase a newly introduced index-based livestock insurance product and three rounds of household panel data, we establish that current coverage generates statistically significant gains in buyer's SWB. The ex ante gains more than offset the statistically significant buyer's remorse effect of having lost money on insurance that did not pay out. These results suggest that insurance can have significant impact on SWB and illustrate that failure to control for potential buyer's remorse effects can bias downwards estimates of the welfare gains from insurance coverage.
Chapter three concerns with the determinants of crop diversification in Ugandan agriculture. I use three rounds of the Uganda National Panel Survey (UNPS) data, which collects detailed information on land holding and characteristics, crop production, agricultural inputs and farm management practices to examine the prime motives for observed crop diversification practices. The findings show that crop diversification is determined by a combination of yield and variance considerations, and that these considerations vary by crop type. Among the main crops in Uganda, inter-cropping of beans and sweet potatoes appears to be primarily driven by average yield considerations while variance (risk) appears to factor prominently in maize inter-cropping decisions. Maize and beans are best suited for inter-cropping, whereas sorghum and matoke yield better results when planted as mono crops. The maize-beans combination is the best crop mix. I also find that crop yields are lower and yield variance higher on larger plots, suggesting the inverse productivity-size phenomenon is present in Ugandan agriculture."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:17Z (GMT).

As esports bridges across fan practices exhibited in popular communication, sociology of sports, leisure studies and video game studies, so too does this research project. Going from the media object, to fan communal practices, to individual fan practices, this research draws on a range of theories from framing, sports geography, and fan identity to better understand this emerging media form.  The nexus of all of these theories is to combine understanding fan practices with a grounded theory approach.
The central argument of this research is that, by elucidating these practices, scholars can better understand not only the emerging practices of fans but how they reflect core identities of the fans. Fans shape not only through our practices of fandom what it means as a communal activity, but how central the identity is to their own everyday lives. A backbone of fan identity is how gender is reflected back through the practice of being a fan. No matter the medium of the fan object itself, video games or other, a central component to our understanding of being a fan is how fan practices reflect gender stereotypes ‚Äì and esports is no exception.
To examine these arguments, I executed three studies using multiple methods. I used textual analysis, field observation, and personal interviews to analyze fans from a multitude of perspectives. Bringing these different methods together in the end, I reflect on our understanding of what it means to be a fan of not just esports but more broadly of entertainment mediums like sports. The theoretical implications suggest a need to update the scholarship‚Äôs understanding of sport and fandom. The practical applications are that, in this media rich world, we must better understand what fans do in everyday life."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:30Z (GMT).

In addition to providing a repository for recent experiences, memory supports a wide range of cognitive functions including navigation, imagination, and sensory perception. While some facets of memory are well understood, including the essential role that the hippocampus plays in many forms of learning and the importance of neocortical regions for long-term memory storage, a complete mechanistic explanation for how memory supports cognition remains out of reach. A major obstacle is a lack of research into the form and development of neocortical memory representations, and how they participate in cognitive processes. To therefore provide insight into the role that neocortical regions play in memory, I examined the activity of large populations of neurons in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) in awake, behaving rats as they performed spatial navigation tasks. The RSC is active during many memory-based cognitive functions in both humans and rats, and lesions of the RSC cause multiple forms of amnesia, including an inability to navigate. I find that neuronal activity patterns in the RSC form rich representations of two of the most important components of memory: space and time. I demonstrate that spatial representations develop slowly in the RSC over the course of many experiences, and that these representations are particularly sensitive to the spatial arrangement of the environment. I also found that the moment-to-moment nature of these representations correlates with the rat‚Äôs navigational proficiency, and that they can be used to predict the rat‚Äôs future navigation behaviors, including upcoming memory failures. Lastly, I show that the activity of RSC ensembles selectively represents the rat‚Äôs future goal location during instances when the rat must select between multiple destinations. Thus, my research provides support for the idea that neocortical memory regions support cognition through the reactivation of long-term memory representations relevant to the current behavior.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:18Z (GMT).

Over the last century, the historic city center, Ulus, has suffered the impacts of rapid urban development. The area has not had a functional preservation strategy since 2005. Today, large numbers of Ankara‚Äôs historic structures undergo significant alteration or even demolition to accommodate new development.  This thesis surveys Ulus‚Äô history, then focuses on the last 30 years to determine what happened. It is a first attempt at understanding how to design and implement a new strategy for Ulus that will preserve its historic cultural resources while accommodating the pressures of a rapidly expanding city. It finds that the lack of communication between various stakeholders has caused resistance to any possible strategies. Creating a viable master plan for Ulus will involve significant legal and administrative alterations to the preservation canon.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:12Z (GMT).

Here we aimed to engineer biomimetic two-dimensional poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel models of the muscle stem cell microenvironment with independent control of biomolecular and mechanical stimuli to expand MuSCs without loss of their essential stem-cell phenotype as defined by molecular (Pax7 expression) and functional characterization (in vivo transplantation). Inspired by the role of acute inflammation on MuSC self-renewal, we developed in vitro models combining stimulation by inflammatory cytokines (IL-1Œ±, IL-13, TNFŒ±, IFNŒ≥) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibition in conjunction with mechano-sensing imparted by a tunable modulus (rigidity) hydrogel substrate to stimulate MuSC expansion. We demonstrated that a muscle-like rigidity (~10 kPa elastic modulus) synergistically promoted long-term MuSC expansion with the cytokine and p38 inhibitor treatments. We observed that this system exhibits control of MuSC phenotypes for 4-5 weeks of culture in terms of proliferative expansion (~106‚Äì108-fold) and myogenic differentiation as indicated by MuSC immunostaining and RT-qPCR. Our findings suggest that reliably large pools of MuSCs can be maintained long-term, establishing a platform for the further optimization of in vitro personalized modeling and medicine.		12/20/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:19Z (GMT).

Growing evidence suggests that SIRT2 plays important roles in cell cycle regulation, stress response, metabolism and differentiation by deacetylating a wide variety of substrates. Targeting SIRT2 for cancer treatment has been a topic of debate due to conflicting reports and lack of potent and specific inhibitors. 
I began the project with the development and mechanistic study of SIRT2 inhibitors. From a collection of mechanism-based small molecule inhibitors mimicking different lysine acyl modifications, I characterized that a thiomyristoyl lysine compound (TM), a potent SIRT2-specific inhibitor, has broad anticancer effect in various human cancer cells and mouse models of breast cancer. Mechanistically, I demonstrated that SIRT2 inhibition promotes c-Myc ubiquitination and degradation and that the anticancer effect of TM correlates with its ability to decrease c-Myc level. This study suggests that SIRT2 inhibition could be utilized to target c-Myc and that potent and selective SIRT2 inhibitors are promising anticancer agents.
SIRT2 has been reported to have lysine defatty-acylase activity in addition to the previously known deacetylase activity. However, whether the defatty-acylase activity is physiologically relevant has not been investigated. I identified the oncoprotein K-Ras4a as a SIRT2 defatty-acylase substrate. I further elucidated that SIRT2-mediated lysine defatty-acylation promotes endomembrane localizaiton of K-Ras4a, enhances its interaction with A-Raf, and thus promotes cellular transformation. This study not only highlights lysine fatty acylation as a previously unknown regulatory mechanism for the Ras family of GTPases that is distinct from cysteine fatty acylation, but also unveils a new mechanism by which SIRT2 is involved in cancer by defatty-acylating K-Ras4a. This finding also provides further support that SIRT2 is a promising target for cancer treatment."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:19Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Some fault parameters of the earthquake, however, can only be estimated probabilistically for a future event. The bathymetry, on the other hand, is surveyed with an imperfect resolution and accuracy, which can lead to errors in the tsunami modeling results. Hence, tsunami assessments before an event are unavoidably uncertain. This thesis aims to describe how the uncertainties of some earthquake fault parameters and bathymetry impact the tsunami assessment uncertainties.
The earthquake uncertainties are related with the assumed aleatory nature of the slip distribution and the rupture location, while the bathymetry uncertainties are associated with the lack of data in unsurveyed areas. These uncertain inputs and the corresponding tsunami response are modeled as random elements by adopting a stochastic approach. The uncertain earthquakes of this thesis consider a slip distribution modeled as an homogeneous random field and a rupture location modeled as a random vector. The bathymetry, on the other hand, is modeled as a non-homogeneous Gaussian random field, which is conditional to surveyed data. The generation of samples of the earthquake rupture location is straightforward. Conversely, the generation of samples of the slip distribution and bathymetry are rather complex. By means of a Karhunen-Loeve expansion and a translation model we propose a consistent method for the generation of samples of these uncertain inputs. Unlike other approaches, the Karhunen Loeve expansion generates consistent and accurate samples of non-rectangular random fields. The uncertainties of tsunami hazard assessments are then quantified by means of a Stochastic Reduced Order Model (SROM), which is more accurate than the classic Monte Carlo simulation for a same number of samples.
The uncertainty quantification methods developed in this thesis are presented with two illustration cases. In one illustration case we study MW 8.0 earthquakes within a seismogenic region in North Chile. First, we demonstrate that our proposed method generates consistent earthquake and bathymetry samples. Second, we demonstrate that estimates of tsunami assessment uncertainties obtained with SROM are more accurate than estimates obtained with classic Monte Carlo simulations. From sensitivity analyses and comparison with records of the 2014 earthquake tsunami, we also conclude that the probability properties of the analyzed uncertain inputs and other aspects of the tsunami assessment can be relevant sources of uncertainty. In the second illustration case we perform a probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment (PTHA) which assesses earthquakes generated in the Manila Subduction Zone and tsunami responses in Hong Kong, China, and Kao Hsiung, Taiwan. First we demonstrate that our proposed methods can be combined with PTHA to account for the earthquake fault parameters and bathymetry uncertainties. Second, we demonstrate that the earthquakes recurrence model and the tsunami propagation model adopted in the PTHA constitute additional sources of uncertainty, which can be as relevant as the uncertainties of the earthquake fault parameters and bathymetry."

Models from mechanism design, algorithm design and auction theory which study these online markets often ignore this important constraint. This dissertation presents a deep study of such markets with budget limited agents, using theoretical models as well as data from real world auction markets. In chapter 2, we study the problem of a budget limited buyer who wants to buy a set of commodities, each from a different seller, to maximize her value. The budget feasible mechanism design problem aims to design a mechanism which incentivizes the sellers to truthfully report their cost, and maximizes the buyer's value while guaranteeing that the total payment does not exceed her budget. Such budget feasible mechanisms can model a principal in a crowdsourcing market interested in recruiting a set of workers (sellers) to accomplish a task for her. We present simple and close to optimum mechanisms for this problem when the valuation of the buyer is a monotone submodular function. In chapter 3, we present a deep study of the behavior of real estate agents in the new online advertising platform provided by Zillow. We analyze behavior of the agents through time using the provided data from Zillow. We use a no-regret based algorithm to estimate the value of agents for impression opportunities. We observe that a significant proportion of bidders initially do not use the bid recommendation tool which has been provided by Zillow. This proportion gradually declines over time. We argue that the agents gradually trust the system by learning that the platform adequately optimizes bids on their behalf and the increased effort of experimenting with alternative bids is not worth the potential increase in their net utility. In chapter 4, we show equilibria of markets with budget limited agents can be used to achieve fairness for problems of matching without money with agents who have preferences over commodities. A unit budget with artificial money is given to each agent for achieving fairness. We also provide polynomial time algorithms for finding the equilibria of these markets.

Recent advances demonstrate that conveniently accessible parameters, including silica precursor chemistry, solvent, and reaction pH, can be used to tune particle size down to below 10 nm. By cooperative assembly of inorganic silica species and organic molecular structure directing agents, a diverse range of mesoporous silica nanoparticles with hexagonal, cubic, and multicompartment structures can be produced. This versatile chemistry provides pathways for answering fundamental questions about structure formation and developing novel functional nanomaterials for applications including separation, catalysis, and drug delivery. In this dissertation, two examples of such silica nanoparticle systems are discussed. 
As a first example, the development of an intensity-based fluorescent silica nanoparticle barcode is discussed. This work is motivated by a need for fluorescent tags that increase the number of molecular species that can be simultaneously labeled and reliably distinguished using commercially available fluorescence microscopes. In this study, the synthetic parameters that govern the incorporation of precisely controlled numbers of fluorescent dyes into silica nanoparticles in batch reactions are identified. Heterogeneities within particle batches are mapped using single particle fluorescence microscopy. Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate that fluorescent silica nanoparticles with well-separated high and low fluorescence intensity distribution levels can be synthesized in batch reactions and used as an intensity barcode in fluorescence microscopy.
In the second example, a mesoporous silica nanoparticle system, structure directed by surfactant-micelle self-assembly, is investigated. As a function of an added pore expander molecule or reaction stirring rate, a series of four distinct mesoporous silica nanoparticle structures is observed: hexagonal, cubic/hexagonal multicompartment, cubic, and dodecagonal quasicrystalline. The mechanism driving the structural transition between cubic crystalline and dodecagonal quasicrystalline mesoporous silica nanoparticles is investigated. Control of nanoparticle size down to a single tiling unit (< 30 nm), allows direct comparison between experimental results and a simple theoretical growth model, providing insights into the early growth trajectories of quasicrystalline mesoporous silica. This work identifies simple synthetic control parameters for quasicrystal growth that may be translated to other self-assembled systems."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:31Z (GMT).

Burrow, Anthony L.||Hamilton, Stephen Frederic	2018-10-22T17:23:14Z			5/30/18		On April 8, 1935, Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act. Under the authority of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act, President Roosevelt established the Resettlement Administration. A major initiative of the Resettlement Administration was the development of Resettlement Projects. Resettlement Projects were developed to take impoverished families off land too poor to yield for resettlement on more productive land. In the literature on the New Deal, two narratives have emerged on Resettlement Projects. First, there is the notion that the Resettlement Projects program helped revitalized portions of Rural America and attained a substantial amount of success in terms of providing security and farm income for many families. In an alternative narrative, Resettlement Projects are viewed as a living nightmare for former slaves and their descendants. At the time of the Depression, Rural Blacks living in the South faced the greatest threat to their economic survival. Few researchers have sought to explore the connection between agricultural policies in the New Deal and Black inequality in the South in the 21st century.  This dissertation explores this connection through three separate but interrelated papers:  In Paper One, I contribute to the literature on rural poverty among minorities in the South by providing a historical analysis of wealth accumulation and power disparity in East Carroll Parish. I engage the literature on power disparities by presenting a case study of power in the rural and southern context. I also make the argument that power in East Carroll Parish has developed over the years into three-dimensions, and I provide systematic evidence on the development of each dimension. In addition, I explore the historical development of wealth inequality in East Carroll Parish through slavery and the Resettlement Administration. In Paper Two, I explore the historical relationship between Resettlement Projects and inequality among Blacks in Southern counties. From a macro approach, I utilize county estimates of inequality from the 2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS) and the 2007 U.S. Census of Agriculture to determine if there a statistical significant difference between the number of Blacks in poverty within Resettlement Project (RP) counties and Non-Resettlement Project counties (Non-RP)? In order to explore this question, this paper incorporates two distinct analyses: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression and a Blinder-Oaxaca Decomposition Model. In Paper Three, I investigate the impact of Resettlement Projects on Southern counties between 1930 and 1945. The analysis in this paper explores whether Resettlement Projects had an impact on components of agriculture production and farm ownership in Southern counties between 1930 and 1945. To conduct this analysis, I employ county-level data that includes measures of agricultural production and farm ownership stratified by race in 1930 and 1945. I view the implementation of a Resettlement Project in a county as a policy treatment, and through the use of a difference-in-difference methodology, I contrast the experiences of counties with a Resettlement Project to all other counties.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:14Z (GMT).

Individuals are not only driven by independent incentives but also by social influence as well as social approval and recognition. This dissertation contains three papers concerning the role of peer effects and social status on individuals‚Äô behavior and well-being.
The first chapter analyzes adolescents peer effects on cigarettes consump- tion by considering the popularity (i.e., social network centrality measures) of smokers and non-smokers within high schools. The analysis is based on the Ad- dHealth dataset, which has exhaustive data on social networks in the sampled high schools and detailed information about students and household charac- teristics. We use variations across cohorts within schools by using school fixed effects, lagged peer‚Äôs behavior at the cohort level as well as instrumental vari- ables. We find that the popularity of smokers increases the probability of indi- viduals smoking, while the popularity of non-smokers has the opposite effect. Analogous results apply to the number of cigarettes smoked, as well as the age of initiation. These effects persist up to fourteen years after high school.
The second chapter follows a similar strategy to analyze peer effects on high school GPA. Using AddHealth data, we find that the popularity of good stu- dents in mathematics considerably increases individuals‚Äô math GPA the fol- lowing year, while the popularity of bad students has the opposite effect. The positive effect is somewhat stronger for males, yet the negative effect is much stronger for females. These patterns extend to college participation and com- pletion. Thus, the first two chapters of this dissertation show the importance of social status in mediating the strength of peers‚Äô influence. Individuals seem to ‚Äòfollow‚Äô the behavior of high-status individuals and avoid that of low-status individuals.
The final chapter looks at positional concerns in rural China with respect to rural income and remittances. More specifically, we look at how the average income and average remittances in the local county affect individuals‚Äô subjec- tive well-being (SWB). We find that average rural income has a strong negative effect on SWB, arguably due to income comparisons. However, average remit- tances have a strong positive effect, possibly due to a signal effect of the po- tential opportunities from migration, both for potential migrants and potential remittances receivers."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:32Z (GMT).

In my dissertation, I explore the outcomes of such failures of language in visionary writing. Instead of dwindling into silence in the face of the ineffable, as one might expect, English visionary writing exploits language‚Äôs fecundity. Past work on visionary literature separates so-called mystic visions from what are supposed to be their more poetic counterparts, identifying mystic visions as primarily religious texts and poetic dream visions as primarily literary texts. I argue instead that mystic, what I call ‚Äúwaking,‚Äù visions and dream visions are inextricably linked through the way they engage the reader in the work of the vision. I identify waking and dream visions as a part of visionary literature, a body of writing that questions the sufficiency of language even as it reaches out to the reader to recuperate some of language‚Äôs failures.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:20Z (GMT).

Current methods for producing immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in engineered cells often require refolding steps or secretion across one or more biological membranes. In this work, we describe a robust expression platform for biosynthesis of full-length IgG antibodies in the Escherichia coli cytoplasm. IgGs with clinically relevant antigen- and effector-binding activities are readily produced in the E. coli cytoplasm by grafting antigen-specific variable heavy and light domains into a cytoplasmically stable framework and remodeling the fragment crystallizable domain with amino acid substitutions that promote binding to FcŒ≥ receptors. The resulting cytoplasmic IgGs ‚Äînamed ‚Äúcyclonals‚Äù‚Äî effectively bypass the potentially rate-limiting steps of membrane translocation and glycosylation. Standard antibody discovery techniques often require multiple labor intensive and technically challenging steps that limit the pace at which valuable antibodies can be developed. We addressed this challenge by adapting the cyclonal platform for identification of specific antibody-antigen binding by implementing two different survival selections. Finally, we describe isolation of high-affinity full-length IgGs from combinatorial libraries after just a single round of selection. Taken together, these results show that our E. coli-based platform constitutes a simple yet powerful alternative for rapidly engineering full-length IgG antibodies.		9/11/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:20Z (GMT).

Essay 1
In recent years, the physician practice landscape has been characterized by a shift away from small, single specialty physician practices and towards larger, more integrated providers. Responses to this trend have been mixed, with some hailing it as a cost saving cure-all and others warning about the dangers of increased market power and the potential for anti-competitive behavior. This trade-off has been debated by health care professionals, economists and government agencies in boardrooms, academia and courts. The discussion of integration has been impeded by a failure to carefully define terms and distinguish between two distinct components of integration: administrative and behavioral.  Administrative, or financial, integration happens when providers merge, or hospitals purchase physician practices. This type of integration is associated with increased bargaining power and higher reimbursements. Furthermore, through profit sharing, financial integration can create an incentive for providers to refer patients to other specialists for more tests or more care, some of which may be unnecessary. In contrasts, behavioral integration refers to doctors working together and coordinating care. It has been associated with decreased waste and more efficient care. Previous work has often used measures of administrative integration, such as the share of physician practices owned by hospitals, to proxy for behavioral integration.  Those modeling decisions are understandable as, up to this point, a metric which separately captures behavioral integration in a systematic way has not existed. The lack of a metric has been a hurdle to evaluating these two components separately. In this paper, I use Medicare data on physician patient sharing patterns to develop metrics that capture physician practice integration at the behavioral level. I compare these behavioral integration metrics to a more standard organizational level integration metric. The low correlation, only 0.30, demonstrates that these metrics are distinct. Using all these metrics, I examine the impact of these two types of physician integration on the utilization of medical care. With national data over time, I use changes in integration and utilization within regions to estimate how the different types of integration impact the ability to provide quality care at a low cost, which I refer to as efficiency. As a model of physician behavior predicts, I find that behavioral integration reduces cost while improving quality. In contrasts, financial integration appears to increase cost without having an impact on quality. These results are robust to different measures of behavioral integration and different identification strategies.
Essay 2
When health care providers and managed care organizations (MCOs) bargain, the main tool providers have is the threat to refuse to be in the MCO‚Äôs network. In fact, anecdotal evidence indicates that a major mechanism that practices employ to maximize profits in the face of differing insurer reimbursements, limited capacity and stochastic demand is to choose insurers discriminately. Providers do not accept patients from every MCO, however, providers do not exclusively accept the most profitable MCO. In this paper, I apply these institutional facts to a Nash cooperative bargaining framework to develop a bargaining model that explicitly models the provider‚Äôs disagreement point with the MCOs. In doing this, I am able to solve analytically [Don‚Äôt split infinitives] for the interdependence of prices between MCOs and add to previous bargaining models by making the value of a MCO to a provider more explicit. This model shows the impact of MCO market structure on prices. By introducing provider capacity constraints, I am able to model two important provider-side considerations: the risk capacity will be unused, and the risk that a low-paying patient will displace a higher-paying patient. Neither of these two effects have been previously captured in the bargaining literature, which typically has featured marginal costs as the limiting factor for providers contracting with MCOs. I also show how predictions in my model match empirical observations and estimates from other work. I demonstrate a strong negative association between MCOs‚Äô market power and negotiated prices, and show that the degree of market level price differences predicted by this model is similar to what has been observed. Finally, recent empirical work has found that that price increases for Medicare are positively associated with private MCOs‚Äô prices and that this impact is stronger in areas with more concentrated insurers, and areas in which Medicare patients represent a larger share of the market. My model analytically makes these predictions and can explain the underlying mechanisms.
Essay 3
This paper examines how primary care providers (PCPs) change their referral patterns to specialists after they join a Medicare Shared Savings Program Accountable Care Organization (ACO). We find that primary-care providers respond differently to ACO formation depending on the degree to which the providers have a pre-existing relationship with specialists in the ACO. Relatively speaking, the smaller the previous PCP-specialist relationship, the bigger the response. We also find that primary-care providers without a pre-existing relationship with ACO specialists make up a large share of the ACOs PCPs and referrals. PCPs that sent a large share of referrals to specialists that join an ACO in the years prior to ACO formation decrease the number of patient they refer to those specialists."

The objective of this dissertation research was, therefore, to better understand soil degradation and measures that can be taken to ameliorate the hard pans that have formed in degraded soils.  The research was carried out in the humid Ethiopian highlands where land degradation is severe. 
The detailed study areas were the 113-ha Anjeni and 95-ha Debre Mewi watersheds in the Ethiopian highlands. In both watersheds, 0-45 cm soil penetration resistance (SPR, n=180) and soil physical properties (particle size, organic matter, pH, base ions, cation exchange capacity, silica content, bulk density and moisture content) were determined at 15 cm depth increments for three land uses: cultivated, pasture, and forest. In addition, 32 experimental plots were constructed in the Anjeni watershed to investigate the effects of ripping and liming of soil hardpans on runoff and erosion.   The results show that the mean SPR of agricultural fields was significantly greater (at p<0.05) than that of forest lands. Dense layers with above SPR a critical threshold of ‚â• 2000 kPa were observed in the cultivated and pasture lands starting at a depth of 15-30 cm but did not occur in the undisturbed forest land. Compared with the original forest soils, agricultural fields were: lower in organic matter, CEC, and exchangeable base cations. They were also more acidic, had a higher bulk density and more fine particles (clay and silt), and contained less soluble silica. 
Measurements in the ripped and limed soil in the field experiments in the Anjeni watershed showed that ripping to depths up to 60 cm increased infiltration and decreased runoff. Liming alone, on the contrary, increased runoff likely due to surface sealing.  Deep ripping was not effective in reducing sediment yields and there was a tendency for deeper ripping to increase sediment concentration especially in the beginning of the rain phase. Liming decreased sediment concentrations compared with the unlimed plots.  
Overall, the findings suggest that land degradation is a process where soil physical and chemical properties in agricultural lands deteriorate after deforestation, causing disintegration of soil aggregates resulting in greater sediment concentration in infiltration water that clog macro-pores, thereby disconnecting deep flow paths found in original forest soils.  This in turn decreased baseflow and increased direct runoff.  This process is common in the Ethiopian highlands."		12/18/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:21Z (GMT).

In this paper we develop and apply a formalism based on an extension     of geometric optics that can be used to describe the effects of two     dimensional plasma lenses of arbitrary shape. We apply insights from     catastrophe theory and the study of uniform asymptotic expansions     of integrals to describe the lensing amplification close to fold caustics     and in shadow regions, and explore the effects of image appearance     and disappearance at caustics in the TOA perturbations due to lensing.     We find that the enhanced geometric optics approach successfully reproduces     the predictions from wave optics, and that it can be efficiently used     to simulate multifrequency TOA residuals during lensing events. Lensing     will introduce perturbations in these residuals that will manifest     as an increased spreading in the data points at lower frequencies,     and will deviate from the expected dispersive $\nu^{-2}$ scaling     most significantly when including observations at low frequencies,     $\nu<0.7$ GHz.

The topic of climate change poses new challenges for educators intent on not only informing audiences but informing in such a way that creates lasting impact. The purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate the extent to which extent climate change communication and environmental psychology research can influence environmental education practice. Interviews with educators from five climate change related professional development programs and networks revealed a high level of awareness of climate change communication and related research. Educators accessed research through a variety of means and reported both practice change and a sense of validation as a result of the research. They also reported some tension between practice knowledge and research-based knowledge. This work begins to fill a gap both in our understanding of how informal educators communicate about climate change and in how they use research in their practice.

Sporadic informal observations over several decades (and more formally in recent work of Lewis and Overton) suggest that such methods also seem to work surprisingly well on nonsmooth functions. This thesis explores this phenomenon from several perspectives. First, Powell‚Äôs fundamental 1976 convergence proof for the popular Broyden-Fletcher- Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) quasi-Newton method for smooth convex functions in fact extends to some nonsmooth settings. Secondly, removing the influence of linesearch techniques and introducing linesearch-free quasi-Newton approaches (including a version of Shor‚Äôs R algorithm), shows in particular how repeated quasi-Newton updating at a single point can serve as a separation technique for convex sets. Lastly, an experimental comparison, in the nonsmooth setting, of the two most popular smooth quasi-Newton updates, BFGS and Symmetric Rank-One, emphasizes the power of the BFGS update.

The public school is a building unlike any other in the scope of its reach and impact as part of the built environment of a community. In cities, villages, and rural areas across the country, public schools are vital community anchors. Yet in New York State, these buildings do not have the protections that are offered other types of historic and culturally significant properties. The public schools of Auburn, New York state are part of a state-mandated system by which public funds are used to subsidize major capital projects and additions. This system of construction underwriting, combined with an inherently anti-preservation mindset, presents challenges to preserving and protecting active historic public school buildings. 
The purpose of this work is to provide a framework for school boards to think about how best to address the judicial, legal, and public perception challenges arrayed against the preservation of public school buildings. It illustrates the fallacy of the commonly held belief that newer school buildings produce higher student achievement and are therefore better. It reveals the way in which the current building aid structuring favors new construction projects and incentivizes the deferment of proper school maintenance. It suggests both general approaches and specific ways in which school districts like Auburn‚Äôs can help to protect its historic school buildings. It is hoped that the introduction of measures that encourage preservation of historic schools through proper maintenance will be supported by New York State‚Äôs Education Department."

Direct quantitation of catalytic activity at the bimetallic interface is important for understanding the enhancement mechanism, but challenging experimentally. Using single-molecule super-resolution catalysis imaging in correlation with electron microscopy, we report the first quantitative visualization of enhanced bimetallic activity within single bimetallic nanoparticles. We focus on heteronuclear bimetallic PdAu nanoparticles that present a well-defined Pd-Au bimetallic interface in catalyzing a photo-driven fluorogenic disproportionation reaction. Our approach also enables a direct comparison between the bimetallic and monometallic regions within the same nanoparticle. Theoretical calculations further provide insights into the electronic nature of N‚ÄìO bond activation of the reactant (resazurin) adsorbed on bimetallic sites. Sub-particle activity correlation between bimetallic enhancement and monometallic activity suggests that the favorable locations to construct bimetallic sites are those monometallic sites with higher activity, leading to a strategy for making effective bimetallic nanocatalysts. The results highlight the power of super-resolution catalysis imaging in gaining insights that could help improve nanocatalysts.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:33Z (GMT).

A global effort has been undertaken to develop advanced lithium-ion battery (LIB) technologies for the electrification of transportation, with the goal of significantly reducing fossil fuel consumption. In current LIBs, energy density is mainly limited by the capacity and thermodynamics of cathode materials. So improvements in cathode materials are critically needed, particularly for demanding electric vehicle applications. The studies have focused on a series of high-performance cathode materials for LIBs. Key synthesis parameters including pH, stirring rate and calcination temperature have been fully optimized for the LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 cathode material using a co-precipitation-calcination two-step scalable process. A high-rate performance LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 cathode material with preferentially orientated lithium-diffusing channels also successfully developed. In addition, the carbon fiber decorated Ni-rich LiNi0.88Mn0.06Co0.06O2 composites, exhibited enhanced rate capability and stability due to the faster ionic/electronic diffusion and shorter diffusion path benefited from the carbon fiber network structure. Finally, a class of high-energy phenothiazine-derived redox-active polymers that deliver high capacities at ultrafast discharge rates have been studied.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:15Z (GMT).

Chapter one studies the inter-generational effects of maternal early childhood shocks on the human capital outcomes of children. I exploit the 1983-1985 Ethiopian famine as an exogenous source of variation to study the effects of exposure to severe shocks in utero and/ or during the first three years after birth on the cognitive, non-cognitive and health capabilities of children of mothers who were exposed to shocks in early childhood. Using data that track children from early childhood through adolescence, I estimate the effects of mothers' early childhood shock over their children's life cycle. I find that the famine had a lasting inter-generational effect. Mothers' early childhood famine exposure reduces their children's height-for-age z-score, schooling, locus of control and self-esteem. These effects are persistent from age one through early adolescence. The main inter-generational transmission channel of the shock is children's maternal human capital endowment. Mothers who suffered the famine in early childhood are shorter and have less schooling. I also find a critical maternal shock duration threshold of three months. These findings point to ineffectiveness of remediation once the damage is done to mothers as young girls. The policy implication is that girls under the age of three with high risk of crossing the critical famine duration threshold should be targeted for health and nutritional interventions. 
In chapter two, coauthored with Christopher B. Barrett, Erin Lentz and Birhanu Ayana, we estimate the causal effects of index insurance coverage on the subjective well-being (SWB) of a poor population in rural southern Ethiopia. Insurance coverage may be welfare enhancing ex ante by reducing exposure to risk. Yet, if the insurance policy lapses without payout, but having paid a premium, the buyer will be financially worse off and may experience buyer's remorse ex post of the resolution of uncertainty. The ex ante and ex post well-being effects of insurance may therefore differ, especially in the absence of indemnity payments. We separately identify (1) the ex ante SWB effects of current insurance coverage that arise from reducing ex ante risk exposure to potential shocks, and (2) the ex post buyer's remorse effects of lapsed insurance policies that did not pay out. By exploiting the randomization of incentives to purchase a newly introduced index-based livestock insurance product and three rounds of household panel data, we establish that current coverage generates statistically significant gains in buyer's SWB. The ex ante gains more than offset the statistically significant buyer's remorse effect of having lost money on insurance that did not pay out. These results suggest that insurance can have significant impact on SWB and illustrate that failure to control for potential buyer's remorse effects can bias downwards estimates of the welfare gains from insurance coverage.
Chapter three concerns with the determinants of crop diversification in Ugandan agriculture. I use three rounds of the Uganda National Panel Survey (UNPS) data, which collects detailed information on land holding and characteristics, crop production, agricultural inputs and farm management practices to examine the prime motives for observed crop diversification practices. The findings show that crop diversification is determined by a combination of yield and variance considerations, and that these considerations vary by crop type. Among the main crops in Uganda, inter-cropping of beans and sweet potatoes appears to be primarily driven by average yield considerations while variance (risk) appears to factor prominently in maize inter-cropping decisions. Maize and beans are best suited for inter-cropping, whereas sorghum and matoke yield better results when planted as mono crops. The maize-beans combination is the best crop mix. I also find that crop yields are lower and yield variance higher on larger plots, suggesting the inverse productivity-size phenomenon is present in Ugandan agriculture."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:34Z (GMT).

A survey tested the acceptance level of the public toward mandates for affordable housing and energy efficient housing as discrete programs for residential development.   Data was collected using interviews of key stakeholders and policy implementers in Tompkins County, New York. The Cornell Institute for Social and Economic Research conducted the survey as part of the annual Empire State Poll. There were three hypotheses, the first being that requiring energy efficient, affordable housing is an unpopular concept in New York State. The second hypothesis was that local land use regulations limit affordable, energy efficient development. The third hypothesis was that housing development that is both energy efficient and affordable is not a high priority concept for community planners. The results from the survey reveal that the residents of New York State supports housing development that is affordable and that is energy efficient. Data collected from interviews of planners, lenders and developers in Tompkins County, New York indicate local land use regulations have an impact on residential development in a variety of ways, but that affordable, energy efficient housing is a high priority in the county. This research brings forth possible solutions for changes to zoning ordinances that may encourage developers to build housing units that are affordable to a broad range of socioeconomic levels and meet the needs of a diverse community such as Tompkins County, New York.

In addition to providing a repository for recent experiences, memory supports a wide range of cognitive functions including navigation, imagination, and sensory perception. While some facets of memory are well understood, including the essential role that the hippocampus plays in many forms of learning and the importance of neocortical regions for long-term memory storage, a complete mechanistic explanation for how memory supports cognition remains out of reach. A major obstacle is a lack of research into the form and development of neocortical memory representations, and how they participate in cognitive processes. To therefore provide insight into the role that neocortical regions play in memory, I examined the activity of large populations of neurons in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) in awake, behaving rats as they performed spatial navigation tasks. The RSC is active during many memory-based cognitive functions in both humans and rats, and lesions of the RSC cause multiple forms of amnesia, including an inability to navigate. I find that neuronal activity patterns in the RSC form rich representations of two of the most important components of memory: space and time. I demonstrate that spatial representations develop slowly in the RSC over the course of many experiences, and that these representations are particularly sensitive to the spatial arrangement of the environment. I also found that the moment-to-moment nature of these representations correlates with the rat‚Äôs navigational proficiency, and that they can be used to predict the rat‚Äôs future navigation behaviors, including upcoming memory failures. Lastly, I show that the activity of RSC ensembles selectively represents the rat‚Äôs future goal location during instances when the rat must select between multiple destinations. Thus, my research provides support for the idea that neocortical memory regions support cognition through the reactivation of long-term memory representations relevant to the current behavior.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:34Z (GMT).

It does so by tracking how Finland‚Äôs nuclear energy and waste experts made visions of distant future Finlands appear more intelligible through mundane corporate, regulatory, financial, and technoscientific practices. Each chapter unpacks how informants iterated and reiterated traces of the very familiar to establish shared grounds of continuity for moving forward in time. Chapter 1 explores how Finland‚Äôs energy sector‚Äôs ‚Äúmankala‚Äù cooperative corporate form was iterated and reiterated to give shape to political and financial time horizons. Chapter 2 explores how workplace role distinctions between recruit/retiree and junior/senior were iterated and reiterated to reckon nuclear personnel successions‚Äô intergenerational horizons. Chapter 3 explores how input/output and part/whole distinctions were iterated and reiterated to help model distant future worlds in a portfolio of ‚ÄúSafety Case‚Äù evidence made to demonstrate the Olkiluoto repository‚Äôs safety to Finnish nuclear regulator STUK. Chapter 4 explores how Safety Case experts iterated and reiterated memories of a deceased predecessor figure in everyday engagements with deep time. What emerges are three insights about how futures attain discernible features ‚Äì insights about the ‚Äúcontinuity,‚Äù ‚Äúthinkability,‚Äù and ‚Äúextensibility‚Äù of expert thought ‚Äì that, I argue, can help twenty-first century experts better navigate not only deep time, but also unknown futures of nuclear technologies, planetary environment, and expertise itself.

In the hole-doped cuprates, experiments on a wide variety of compounds with differing structure and composition enable the disentangling of material-specific properties from universal ones. In the electron-doped cuprates, due to a limited availability of thermodynamically stable compounds, much of the experimental work has been focused on the so-called T‚Äô cuprates, with most of those efforts focused on Nd2‚àíxCexCuO4, for which the highest quality single crystals can be grown. Epitaxial growth can be used to stabilize metastable compounds in thin film form and expand the range of materials available for study. In this dissertation, we use a combination of in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and ex situ probes to study thin film samples of the electron-doped cuprates T‚Äô-La2CuO4 (T‚Äô-LCO) and infinite-layer Sr1‚àíxLaxCuO4 (SLCO), both metastable in bulk. In T‚Äô-LCO, we have used ARPES to directly measure its band structure and show that it is electron-doped without cation doping, the first such report in an electron-doped cuprate. We also show that its carrier concentration can be controlled by compensating electron carriers with doped holes by substituting Sr2+ for La3+, driving the system back into a Mott insulating state. We propose that intrinsic oxygen vacancy defects are responsible for electron doping in this compound, suggesting a new route towards electron doping in the cuprates and highlighting the importance of oxygen stoichiometry in the properties of electron-doped cuprates. In SLCO, we have used resonant soft x-ray scattering (RSXS) at the Cu L3 and O K edge to study charge ordering in the Cu-O plane, finding a unique form of charge ordering with a long and nearly doping-independent periodicity of eight unit cells and with possible correlations along both the Cu-O bond directions as well as diagonal to them. This behavior is totally unlike what has been seen in the hole-doped cuprates as well as electron-doped Nd2‚àíxCexCuO4, nearly all of which show stripe ordering along the Cu-O bond direction with 3 to 5 unit cell periodicity. Our results show that charge ordering in electron-doped cuprates has a dramatically different phenomenology to that in the hole-doped cuprates, a fact which may be related to the differing orbital characters of electron and hole carriers in the cuprates as well as the higher strength of antiferromagnetic correlations in the electron-doped cuprates..		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:17Z (GMT).

In animals, maternal choline supplementation (MCS) improves offspring behavior, but few studies have tested this in humans. In the present RCT, MCS caused higher placental and lower cord NR3C1 methylation, which is opposite the pattern associated with early adversity and offspring behavior problems in prior studies. We tested the independent associations between MCS and NR3C1 methylation and child behavior (BASC-III; n=21) at age 7, using adjusted linear regression.  Mothers consumed 480 or 930 mg choline/d during the 3rd trimester. Cord blood and placentas were collected at delivery for methylation analysis, which focused on average and site-specific NR3C1 methylation. The 930 mg group reported fewer emotional self-control problems. Cord CpG 30-32 methylation was associated with fewer internalizing and anxiety problems. Results suggest that choline-induced changes in NR3C1 methylation may have functional consequences for child behavior.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:22Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Here we aimed to engineer biomimetic two-dimensional poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel models of the muscle stem cell microenvironment with independent control of biomolecular and mechanical stimuli to expand MuSCs without loss of their essential stem-cell phenotype as defined by molecular (Pax7 expression) and functional characterization (in vivo transplantation). Inspired by the role of acute inflammation on MuSC self-renewal, we developed in vitro models combining stimulation by inflammatory cytokines (IL-1Œ±, IL-13, TNFŒ±, IFNŒ≥) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibition in conjunction with mechano-sensing imparted by a tunable modulus (rigidity) hydrogel substrate to stimulate MuSC expansion. We demonstrated that a muscle-like rigidity (~10 kPa elastic modulus) synergistically promoted long-term MuSC expansion with the cytokine and p38 inhibitor treatments. We observed that this system exhibits control of MuSC phenotypes for 4-5 weeks of culture in terms of proliferative expansion (~106‚Äì108-fold) and myogenic differentiation as indicated by MuSC immunostaining and RT-qPCR. Our findings suggest that reliably large pools of MuSCs can be maintained long-term, establishing a platform for the further optimization of in vitro personalized modeling and medicine.		12/20/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:35Z (GMT).

As such, Montaigne is seen to embody one of the most complex, unique, and critical forms of subjectivity: early-modern melancholic subjectivity, as it will be surveyed in this dissertation through a wide variety of literary and visual concepts and figures that engage and resonate with one other, to produce the ‚Äúworld‚Äù of early-modern melancholy, rather than just a psychological state. 
A reading of Montaigne‚Äôs Essais as a melancholic text will demonstrate the consistency and unity of a text famous for its heterogeneity and diversity. If these diverse parts of the Essais, ranging from cats to fathers, from honesty to cruelty, from the act of essaying to the critique of custom, from Montaigne‚Äôs views on passions to his views on death, can all be read and enveloped within [one] melancholy, then the implications are both that melancholy is not a pathology defined by lack, but rather a subjectivity, and moreover ‚Äî a privileged subjectivity, whose insight and critical abilities now parallel those of the ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù work of the Essais, as a work of immense complexity, singularity, value, and meaning."

COPVs are currently used mainly in aerospace applications, such as storing the reserve oxygen on the International Space Station. Indeed a carbon/epoxy COPV failure caused the September 2016 explosion of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at Cape Canaveral, leading to more than a billion dollars of damage. Currently COPVs are used in relatively small numbers, but the day is rapidly approaching when they will be used in the millions in many aspects of daily life, particularly in automotive applications. 
My research seeks to better understand stress rupture and more accurately estimate the probability that a specific composite structure will fail in stress rupture. Prediction of a composite‚Äôs stress rupture behavior is heavily based on results from extensive testing, as there are not yet methods to predict a composite‚Äôs stress rupture behavior based on the component materials‚Äô properties. Testing results in comparatively small datasets of accelerated test data, which then must be extrapolated to predict a failure probability for a the service life of interest. This dissertation shows that the method used to analyze these datasets is crucial to accurately estimating the probability of a stress rupture failure, and also presents a data analysis method with lower variance and MSE estimates than current ad-hoc industry methods. Furthermore this dissertation compares current stress rupture models and derives a new, micromechanical stochastic stress rupture model."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:23Z (GMT).

Growing evidence suggests that SIRT2 plays important roles in cell cycle regulation, stress response, metabolism and differentiation by deacetylating a wide variety of substrates. Targeting SIRT2 for cancer treatment has been a topic of debate due to conflicting reports and lack of potent and specific inhibitors. 
I began the project with the development and mechanistic study of SIRT2 inhibitors. From a collection of mechanism-based small molecule inhibitors mimicking different lysine acyl modifications, I characterized that a thiomyristoyl lysine compound (TM), a potent SIRT2-specific inhibitor, has broad anticancer effect in various human cancer cells and mouse models of breast cancer. Mechanistically, I demonstrated that SIRT2 inhibition promotes c-Myc ubiquitination and degradation and that the anticancer effect of TM correlates with its ability to decrease c-Myc level. This study suggests that SIRT2 inhibition could be utilized to target c-Myc and that potent and selective SIRT2 inhibitors are promising anticancer agents.
SIRT2 has been reported to have lysine defatty-acylase activity in addition to the previously known deacetylase activity. However, whether the defatty-acylase activity is physiologically relevant has not been investigated. I identified the oncoprotein K-Ras4a as a SIRT2 defatty-acylase substrate. I further elucidated that SIRT2-mediated lysine defatty-acylation promotes endomembrane localizaiton of K-Ras4a, enhances its interaction with A-Raf, and thus promotes cellular transformation. This study not only highlights lysine fatty acylation as a previously unknown regulatory mechanism for the Ras family of GTPases that is distinct from cysteine fatty acylation, but also unveils a new mechanism by which SIRT2 is involved in cancer by defatty-acylating K-Ras4a. This finding also provides further support that SIRT2 is a promising target for cancer treatment."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:36Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

These three efforts constitute stand-alone chapters. The first of these describes an alternative position and navigation system that estimates absolute aircraft position and velocity based on time-series of accumulated delta range measurements from Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) ground transponders. The second presents a method to mitigate multipath in GNSS signals that rely on an antenna array. The developed method can be used as part of an anti-spoofing system. The third discusses a novel radionavigation system based on passive reflectors in orbit and ground transmitters. The proposed system's ability to change the signal broadcast relatively easily in case the system comes under attack provides a robust navigation system.

Textural and compositional heterogeneity within these carbonates provide evidence of diagenetic evolution. The Cherry Valley carbonates contrast lithologically and petrophysically with bounding organic-rich mudstones, regionally the East Berne Member of the Oatka Creek Formation (overlying) and Bakoven Member of the Union Springs Formation (underlying), and comprise carbon isotope-depleted, methanogenic nodules and pelagic limestones. Petrologic evaluation of these units indicates the presence or absence of early nodule formation controlled the effect of burial, thermal, and exhumation diagenesis on these carbonates. The isotopic compositions of these nodular carbonates, which were deposited as fossiliferous mudstones, reflect an initial depletion of 13C that was recrystallized by isotopically heavier carbon during burial diagenesis. In equivalent mudstones where nodules were not formed, isotopic compositions are comparable to that of unaltered dacryoconarid fossils which are the dominant source of calcite in these rocks. Three depositional facies, which do not reflect subsequent alteration, are related to the Cherry Valley carbonates: (1) a basal calcareous mudstone facies that are rich in algal cysts; (2) an intermediate limestone rich in pelagic fossils that classically defines the Cherry Valley carbonates; (3) an upper-bounding calcareous mudstone facies. Eight cores from West Virginia (3), Pennsylvania (2), and New York (3) are qualitatively and quantitatively described by petrologic methods, including thin section petrography and scanning electron microscopy, and geochemical analyses to integrate lithological, textural, and spatial relationships among the diagenetic framework of these rocks at a range of scales. Compositional analyses describe the distribution of mineral phases and textures, as determined by petrological observation, and include reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of carbonate-derived CO2 gas are measured using off-axis integrated cavity output laser spectroscopy. The general diagenetic sequence for the Cherry Valley carbonates begins with (1) micritization of calcareous mudstones and bedded limestones; (2) methanogenetic formation of calcite or barite nodules; (3) prismatic calcite growth on fossils or allochemical grains (4) crystallization of organogenetic dolomite rhombohedra; (5) pore-filling cements that include sparry carbonates, barite, and pyrite; (6) catagenesis and mobilization of hydrocarbons via fractures and stylolites; (7) late stage calcite crystallization or dolomitization; (8) dedolomitization associated with exhumation.

Laupala are known for their diversification in male acoustic signaling and associated female preferences. They also possess a complex courtship which includes extensive antennal interaction and during which the male gives nuptial gifts. Despite historically being seen as indiscriminate, males are predicted to make mating decisions under certain circumstances, such as when males are limited in the resources they are able to invest in females. Given that females are silent, males are likely using some other signaling modality, such as through contact pheromones on the antennae. Here, I tested the male use of chemical cues in initiating mating decisions, the impact of these cues on species boundaries, and how pheromones may be evolving in relation to song. Using both gas chromatographic analysis and novel behavioral assays, I examined the hypothesis that male L. pruna are using chemical signals to distinguish between males and females. I found that males and females differed quantitatively in their expression of shared peaks. Further, access to the antennae alone was sufficient cause aggressive behavior or courtship behavior towards males and females, respectively. I tested the hypothesis that males are using chemical information to distinguish between species. I used L. pruna and a closely related species, L. kohalensis, and found low interspecific mating success. Chemical analysis also determined that these species differed in their pheromone profiles. Males initiated courtship in the presence of conspecific, but not heterospecific female antennae. I explored the hypothesis that male song and CHC expression are evolving together. I found significant heterogeneity among populations in both signals. The distribution of these signals follows the nonlinear ages of the volcano, versus a simple isolation-by-distance model. Together, these experiments establish chemical communication in male mate choice, demonstrate that differences in chemical expression matter for species boundaries, and suggest that acoustic and chemical signals may be coevolving early in the speciation of Laupala.

In my dissertation, I explore the outcomes of such failures of language in visionary writing. Instead of dwindling into silence in the face of the ineffable, as one might expect, English visionary writing exploits language‚Äôs fecundity. Past work on visionary literature separates so-called mystic visions from what are supposed to be their more poetic counterparts, identifying mystic visions as primarily religious texts and poetic dream visions as primarily literary texts. I argue instead that mystic, what I call ‚Äúwaking,‚Äù visions and dream visions are inextricably linked through the way they engage the reader in the work of the vision. I identify waking and dream visions as a part of visionary literature, a body of writing that questions the sufficiency of language even as it reaches out to the reader to recuperate some of language‚Äôs failures.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:36Z (GMT).

Surveys indicate that re-combinant strains of PVY have emerged in recent years to predominate in the U.S. potato crop and that the genetic diversity among and within PVY strains is prodigious.  Vegetative propaga-tion of potato via tubers allows PVY to survive year to year and to be transported over long dis-tances.  Whereas, aphids are primarily responsible for spread of PVY within the crop and over regional distances.  Furthermore, the tuber necrotic strain (PVYNTN) is associated with potato tuber necrotic ringspot disease (PTNRD), a tuber deformity that negatively impacts tuber quali-ty, marketability, and poses a serious threat to seed and commercial potato production world-wide. To map loci that influence tuber and foliar symptoms in potatoes infected with PVYNTN and the length of tuber dormancy, two potato populations were genotyped with a potato SNP chip.  QTL analyses revealed major-effect QTLs in a Waneta x Pike cross for mosaic on chromosomes 4 and 5, and for PTNRD and for foliar-necrosis symptoms on chromosomes 4 and 5, respective-ly.  QTLs for dormancy were detected on chromosomes 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8, in a Waneta x Superior cross.  Locating QTLs associated with PVY-related symptoms and tuber dormancy provides a framework for breeders to develop varieties with resistance to multiple PVY-symptoms and to manipulate tuber dormancy length. Illumina high-throughput sequencing was used to study the quasispecies diversity of 15 isolates representing seven different PVY strains and to investigate how transmission modes (insect and mechanical) are contributing to the evolution and diversification of PVY.  Eight were PVYN isolates and six of those came from the same geographic region in two different years.  A con-sensus sequence, without indels or insertions, was successfully extracted from the sequenced reads of each isolate after being mapped to the strain reference genome.  PVYN had a higher population genetic diversity than any other strain evaluated and the population genetic diversi-ty of the PVYN isolates, differed between collection years and sites.  We found that the popula-tion diversity of PVY varies by the virus strain but doesn‚Äôt differ among transmission modes.  Our data suggest that each transmission mode exerts unique selection pressures on the virus population and allows different mutations to accumulate and become fixed.  Knowledge of how rapidly PVY can evolve and of the factors driving PVY quasispecies diversity could be used to enhance the efficiency of PVY management practices in potato fields.		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:19Z (GMT).

The first paper traces how the social and environmental landscape of the Mekong Delta was transformed over the course of the 20th century through the construction of water management infrastructures such as dikes, dams, and sluice gates, with the overall aim of increasing rice production. The second paper uses survey data from two areas ‚Äî one engaged in rice agriculture and the other shrimp aquaculture ‚Äî to examine the divergent dynamics of accumulation and dispossession within these two production systems. The final paper focuses on conflicts which have emerged between shrimp farmers and the state around infrastructure projects designed to ensure national food security and adapt to global climate change. As the state has built up new barriers to protect the rice fields of the Mekong, these efforts have encountered resistance from shrimp farmers themselves, who have engaged in acts of ‚Äúcounter-accumulation,‚Äù as by subverting government infrastructure and covertly rebuilding the productive forces in shrimp aquaculture.		5/11/21	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:20Z (GMT).

Current methods for producing immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in engineered cells often require refolding steps or secretion across one or more biological membranes. In this work, we describe a robust expression platform for biosynthesis of full-length IgG antibodies in the Escherichia coli cytoplasm. IgGs with clinically relevant antigen- and effector-binding activities are readily produced in the E. coli cytoplasm by grafting antigen-specific variable heavy and light domains into a cytoplasmically stable framework and remodeling the fragment crystallizable domain with amino acid substitutions that promote binding to FcŒ≥ receptors. The resulting cytoplasmic IgGs ‚Äînamed ‚Äúcyclonals‚Äù‚Äî effectively bypass the potentially rate-limiting steps of membrane translocation and glycosylation. Standard antibody discovery techniques often require multiple labor intensive and technically challenging steps that limit the pace at which valuable antibodies can be developed. We addressed this challenge by adapting the cyclonal platform for identification of specific antibody-antigen binding by implementing two different survival selections. Finally, we describe isolation of high-affinity full-length IgGs from combinatorial libraries after just a single round of selection. Taken together, these results show that our E. coli-based platform constitutes a simple yet powerful alternative for rapidly engineering full-length IgG antibodies.		9/11/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:37Z (GMT).

Much CMC design research has focused on recreating features of face-to-face interaction or in capturing and transmitting rich information. In this thesis, I argue that a focus on rich interaction and rich information transmission overlooks many interesting situations and design choices when rich information is not necessarily beneficial.
More specifically, I explore how ephemeral media, which illuminate the alternative dimension of temporal preservation, particularly on the question of how long to retain content, and how a medium that de-emphasizes content, which highlights interaction rather than information, respectively influence the ways people interact with these tools. These explorations help inform a design space that includes other interesting dimensions such as the message materiality, interaction flow and system fidelity for CMC tools that designers have yet to fully explore. 
My approach to exploring this alternative design space is three-pronged. First, I think critically about the normative designs of CMC tools and consider alternatives to these designs, particularly digital ephemerality and content de-emphasis, as valuable sources for highlighting alternative purposes and goals users aim to achieve. Second, I conduct qualitative studies of users of a conventional CMC tool (Snapchat) and research prototype I have built (BubbleQ) to understand how these designs influence users‚Äô communicative practices. Third, I do iterative designs and evaluation of the prototype I built to advance designs from both my critical thinking and my study findings.
The first study showed that Snapchat‚Äôs ephemerality benefited communication by encouraging mundane interactions that support relationship maintenance between closer relations, reduce consciousness in self-presentation, and mitigate privacy violation issues in content saving and sharing. The second study shows that BubbleQ‚Äôs content de-emphasis design highlighted interaction rather than contents in messaging, leading to an alternative conversational flow that encouraged mundane and lightweight talk for social connection and helped highlight meanings in messages without explicit contents.
I use my findings to explore my two focal dimensions (temporal preservation and the focus on interaction rather than contents) more deeply. I also discuss the implications of formatively designing alternatives by assessing the materiality of digital messages, interaction flows that define the rhythm and speed of communication processes, and alternative levels of fidelity that violate the conventional emphasis on accuracy and genuineness of contents."

Essay 1
In recent years, the physician practice landscape has been characterized by a shift away from small, single specialty physician practices and towards larger, more integrated providers. Responses to this trend have been mixed, with some hailing it as a cost saving cure-all and others warning about the dangers of increased market power and the potential for anti-competitive behavior. This trade-off has been debated by health care professionals, economists and government agencies in boardrooms, academia and courts. The discussion of integration has been impeded by a failure to carefully define terms and distinguish between two distinct components of integration: administrative and behavioral.  Administrative, or financial, integration happens when providers merge, or hospitals purchase physician practices. This type of integration is associated with increased bargaining power and higher reimbursements. Furthermore, through profit sharing, financial integration can create an incentive for providers to refer patients to other specialists for more tests or more care, some of which may be unnecessary. In contrasts, behavioral integration refers to doctors working together and coordinating care. It has been associated with decreased waste and more efficient care. Previous work has often used measures of administrative integration, such as the share of physician practices owned by hospitals, to proxy for behavioral integration.  Those modeling decisions are understandable as, up to this point, a metric which separately captures behavioral integration in a systematic way has not existed. The lack of a metric has been a hurdle to evaluating these two components separately. In this paper, I use Medicare data on physician patient sharing patterns to develop metrics that capture physician practice integration at the behavioral level. I compare these behavioral integration metrics to a more standard organizational level integration metric. The low correlation, only 0.30, demonstrates that these metrics are distinct. Using all these metrics, I examine the impact of these two types of physician integration on the utilization of medical care. With national data over time, I use changes in integration and utilization within regions to estimate how the different types of integration impact the ability to provide quality care at a low cost, which I refer to as efficiency. As a model of physician behavior predicts, I find that behavioral integration reduces cost while improving quality. In contrasts, financial integration appears to increase cost without having an impact on quality. These results are robust to different measures of behavioral integration and different identification strategies.
Essay 2
When health care providers and managed care organizations (MCOs) bargain, the main tool providers have is the threat to refuse to be in the MCO‚Äôs network. In fact, anecdotal evidence indicates that a major mechanism that practices employ to maximize profits in the face of differing insurer reimbursements, limited capacity and stochastic demand is to choose insurers discriminately. Providers do not accept patients from every MCO, however, providers do not exclusively accept the most profitable MCO. In this paper, I apply these institutional facts to a Nash cooperative bargaining framework to develop a bargaining model that explicitly models the provider‚Äôs disagreement point with the MCOs. In doing this, I am able to solve analytically [Don‚Äôt split infinitives] for the interdependence of prices between MCOs and add to previous bargaining models by making the value of a MCO to a provider more explicit. This model shows the impact of MCO market structure on prices. By introducing provider capacity constraints, I am able to model two important provider-side considerations: the risk capacity will be unused, and the risk that a low-paying patient will displace a higher-paying patient. Neither of these two effects have been previously captured in the bargaining literature, which typically has featured marginal costs as the limiting factor for providers contracting with MCOs. I also show how predictions in my model match empirical observations and estimates from other work. I demonstrate a strong negative association between MCOs‚Äô market power and negotiated prices, and show that the degree of market level price differences predicted by this model is similar to what has been observed. Finally, recent empirical work has found that that price increases for Medicare are positively associated with private MCOs‚Äô prices and that this impact is stronger in areas with more concentrated insurers, and areas in which Medicare patients represent a larger share of the market. My model analytically makes these predictions and can explain the underlying mechanisms.
Essay 3
This paper examines how primary care providers (PCPs) change their referral patterns to specialists after they join a Medicare Shared Savings Program Accountable Care Organization (ACO). We find that primary-care providers respond differently to ACO formation depending on the degree to which the providers have a pre-existing relationship with specialists in the ACO. Relatively speaking, the smaller the previous PCP-specialist relationship, the bigger the response. We also find that primary-care providers without a pre-existing relationship with ACO specialists make up a large share of the ACOs PCPs and referrals. PCPs that sent a large share of referrals to specialists that join an ACO in the years prior to ACO formation decrease the number of patient they refer to those specialists."

We utilize its advantages in high-temporal, high-spatial resolution and correlate the catalytic activity with surface plasmon and catalytic communication.
In Chapter 2 and 3 of this thesis, I report a direct visualization of the activity enhancement at nanoscale gaps between two plasmonic nanoparticles (Au nanorod or Ag nanoparticle), using single-molecule super-resolution catalysis imaging in correlation with electron microscopy. Surface plasmon enhanced catalysis is promising in harvesting light to drive chemical reactions that were otherwise inefficient or to bias the reaction pathways toward more desirable products. Catalytic hotspots at plasmonic hotspots is long predicted,
but experimentally observing it has been challenging, even though it is crucial for understanding the enhancement mechanism. Here, I define the correlations of the enhancement with the nanostructure geometry and local electric field enhancement, and show that the enhancement scales quadratically with the local actual light intensity, reflecting the involvement of plasmon-excitation induced hot electrons in the catalytic enhancement mechanism. This study demonstrates a methodology of applying correlated super-resolution microscopy and electron microscopy to study plasmonic nanocatalysts at the sub-particle level. The results reveal the intimate relation between the activity increase of metal nanocatalysts and local surface plasmon enhancement, demonstrating a long-predicted but hard-to-observe phenomenon in plasmon-enhanced catalysis.
In Chapter 4 and 5 of this thesis, I report both intraparticle and interparticle catalytic communication by analyzing the correlation between temporally subsequent reactions occurring at different locations within and among single nanocatalysts, resolved spatiotemporally using single-molecule fluorescence localization microscopy. This catalytic communication phenomenon, a first-of-its-kind discovery, occurs in three Pd or Au based nanocatalysts and in three distinct catalytic reactions including a photo-induced disproportionation reaction, an oxidative deacetylation reaction, and a reductive deoxygenation reaction. As the catalytic communications are phenomenologically similar and conceptually analogous to synergism in enzymes, which are nature‚Äôs most efficient catalysts, I envision that exploration of their generality and utility may bring new theoretical framework in understanding nanocatalysis."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:24Z (GMT).

A longstanding goal in evolution and ecology is to document patterns of biodiversity and infer the biological processes that contribute to speciation and phenotypic evolution. Here, I take a multidimensional approach to examine the tempo, mode, and mechanisms of phenotypic evolution and speciation in birds. I first document a positive association between rates of vocal evolution and speciation in two large lineages in Neotropical birds. I then explore phenotypic and genetic variation in two lineages of songbirds: the White-collared Seedeater (Sporophila torqueola) and the Holarctic redpoll finches (Acanthis sp.). Finally, I quantify phenotypic change in Horned Lark of the Imperial Valley in southern California, where the desert has been transformed into agricultural land. Collectively, these studies provide different perspectives on avian biodiversity and together illustrate the immense value of natural history collections as repositories of phenotypic and genetic data.		12/18/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:26Z (GMT).

This may be at least in part due to the heterogeneity of AML. A cell line used to model RA-induced differentiation, HL-60, is a non-APL AML, and our lab has recently shown that it may represent a previously uncharacterized subtype of AML. RA itself is known to regulate transcription of hundreds of genes, but the mechanistic details of the signaling pathways essential for differentiation are unclear. Here, we report interactions between the ectoenzyme receptor CD38 and the cytosolic signaling proteins Lyn, Vav1, SLP-76, and PI3K and show that Lyn also interacts with these cytosolic proteins. Building on prior results showing that Src family kinases enhance RA-induced differentiation, we explore the effects of several Src family kinase inhibitors on the process. We find that their effects on Lyn expression rather than their effects on Lyn activity appear to drive the process and that a clinically relevant inhibitor showing relatively low toxicity, bosutinib, behaves similarly to the more toxic inhibitor dasatinib. We also demonstrate that the ectoenzyme receptor CD38, which had a body of literature implicating it as a key driver of RA-induced differentiation, is not essential for the process. CXCR5, a receptor shown to be essential for RA-induced differentiation, drives migration toward its ligand, CXCL13. While the mechanism by which CXCR5 contributes to the differentiation process remains unknown, we show that it does not appear to function via interaction with a number of candidate binding partners (CD11b, CD38, CXCR4, CXCR5, EBI2, c-Cbl, and Lyn). Finally, as histone deacetylases are known to be aberrantly active in various cancers, we show that a drug targeting the histone deacetylase Sirt1 does not affect differentiation, that two broadly targeting Sirt2 enhance differentiation concurrent with signs of toxicity, and that one specifically targeting Sirt2 is toxic but does not enhance differentiation. These findings contribute to the identification of targets to bring differentiation therapy to AML.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:20Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The measurement is performed using data collected by the CMS experiment during the 2016 data-taking period, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. The measurement is performed using events where one top quark decays hadronically and is reconstructed as a single large-radius t jet with pt > 400 GeV, while the other top quark decays leptonically to a b jet, an electron or a muon, and a neutrino. Jet substructure techniques are used to identify the large-radius jet as a t jet candidate. The measurement demonstrates that current simulations overpredict the rate of top quark pair production at high pt, providing valuable feedback on the accuracy of current simulation.

The objective of this dissertation research was, therefore, to better understand soil degradation and measures that can be taken to ameliorate the hard pans that have formed in degraded soils.  The research was carried out in the humid Ethiopian highlands where land degradation is severe. 
The detailed study areas were the 113-ha Anjeni and 95-ha Debre Mewi watersheds in the Ethiopian highlands. In both watersheds, 0-45 cm soil penetration resistance (SPR, n=180) and soil physical properties (particle size, organic matter, pH, base ions, cation exchange capacity, silica content, bulk density and moisture content) were determined at 15 cm depth increments for three land uses: cultivated, pasture, and forest. In addition, 32 experimental plots were constructed in the Anjeni watershed to investigate the effects of ripping and liming of soil hardpans on runoff and erosion.   The results show that the mean SPR of agricultural fields was significantly greater (at p<0.05) than that of forest lands. Dense layers with above SPR a critical threshold of ‚â• 2000 kPa were observed in the cultivated and pasture lands starting at a depth of 15-30 cm but did not occur in the undisturbed forest land. Compared with the original forest soils, agricultural fields were: lower in organic matter, CEC, and exchangeable base cations. They were also more acidic, had a higher bulk density and more fine particles (clay and silt), and contained less soluble silica. 
Measurements in the ripped and limed soil in the field experiments in the Anjeni watershed showed that ripping to depths up to 60 cm increased infiltration and decreased runoff. Liming alone, on the contrary, increased runoff likely due to surface sealing.  Deep ripping was not effective in reducing sediment yields and there was a tendency for deeper ripping to increase sediment concentration especially in the beginning of the rain phase. Liming decreased sediment concentrations compared with the unlimed plots.  
Overall, the findings suggest that land degradation is a process where soil physical and chemical properties in agricultural lands deteriorate after deforestation, causing disintegration of soil aggregates resulting in greater sediment concentration in infiltration water that clog macro-pores, thereby disconnecting deep flow paths found in original forest soils.  This in turn decreased baseflow and increased direct runoff.  This process is common in the Ethiopian highlands."		12/18/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:38Z (GMT).

Inland and coastal populations of the North American swamp sparrow (Melospiza georgiana) have become an emerging model system for studies of natural selection because they are morphologically and behaviorally distinct despite a very recent divergence time (<15,000 years), yet common garden experiments have demonstrated a genetic basis for their differences. I characterized genomic patterns of variation within and between inland and coastal swamp sparrows via reduced representation sequencing and demonstrated that background genomic differentiation (FST=0.02) and divergence (Œ¶ST=0.05) between these populations is very low, rendering signatures of natural selection highly detectable (max FST=0.8). I then sequenced and assembled a de novo reference genome for the species and conducted a scan for genes involved in coastal adaptation, particularly the evolution of a deeper bill, darker plumage, and tolerance for salinity. I recovered a multigenic snapshot of adaptation via robust signatures of selection at 31 genes. As in Darwin‚Äôs finches, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling appears responsible for changes in bill depth, a putative magic trait for ecological speciation. Genes for salinity tolerance constituted the majority of candidates (23/31), including genes involved in regulating osmotic balance via vasoconstriction and intracellular vesicle trafficking. I then quantified genotype-phenotype associations in a naturally occurring hybrid zone between inland and coastal swamp sparrows and demonstrated that melanism in coastal swamp sparrows is a product of both direct positive selection and molecular ‚Äúspandrel‚Äù effects. Black plumage patches are the product of intrasexual selection on a melanin-specific transcription factor (BNC2), whereas black legs are a pleiotropic consequence of selection on a vesicle trafficking gene involved in salt tolerance (BLOC1S2). Pleiotropic effects of vesicle trafficking may therefore explain why other salt marsh birds, snakes and mammals have also evolved darker coloration in a phenomenon known as ‚Äúsalt marsh melanism‚Äù. Natural selection has therefore driven genetic, ecological and phenotypic divergence in the swamp sparrow, and possibly other locally adapted salt marsh lineages, through a combination of direct and indirect molecular mechanisms.

Typically, carbon is used as the active material for the CDI electrodes and is considered to be at the heart of this application. Understanding the role of the design parameters of porous carbon on the electrosorption is especially important to maximize the capacitive deionization electrode performance. Amongst different types of carbon structures, hierarchical porous carbons HPCs have been proposed as promising materials for capacitive deionization electrodes due to their excellent electrosorption performance. However, the typically low mesopore fraction and broad pore size distribution limits their utilization in correlating between the pore matrices and the CDI performance.  In this work we report the capacitive deionization performance of a series of HPCs synthesized via ice templation with a high fraction of mesopores and tight control over the amount and the size of mesopores. To assure close probing and accurate investigations of the relationship between the pore matrices and the electrosorption performance, the synthesized porous carbons were categorized into two categories; category I include predominantly meso-macro porous carbons and category II include combination of multilevel of porosities (micro-meso-macro) porous carbons. For the category I, the aim is to investigate how tuning the mesopore size, mesopore volume and the BET surface area affect the final performance of meso-macro porous carbons. While for category II, the aim is to understand how different mesopore structure behave as capacitive deionization electrode after the introduction of micropores.  Besides the high salt capacity and fast removal rates that can be obtained by the synthesized HPCs, we believe that the adapted approach can offer a new platform to delineate the impact of specific mesopore (pore size and volume) as part of a hierarchical structure on the electrosorption behavior. The outcomes of this study (i.e. the existing correlations, broad trends, synergetic effects of micro-meso structure) can potentially be applicable to other types of carbons especially; mesopores carbons and micro-meso pore carbons. Accordingly, this understanding of the role of some of the design parameter of porous carbons can guide and provides a roadmap for further investigation, better design and development of porous carbons, and ultimately pave the way for practical applications of capacitive deionization.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:21Z (GMT).

It does so by tracking how Finland‚Äôs nuclear energy and waste experts made visions of distant future Finlands appear more intelligible through mundane corporate, regulatory, financial, and technoscientific practices. Each chapter unpacks how informants iterated and reiterated traces of the very familiar to establish shared grounds of continuity for moving forward in time. Chapter 1 explores how Finland‚Äôs energy sector‚Äôs ‚Äúmankala‚Äù cooperative corporate form was iterated and reiterated to give shape to political and financial time horizons. Chapter 2 explores how workplace role distinctions between recruit/retiree and junior/senior were iterated and reiterated to reckon nuclear personnel successions‚Äô intergenerational horizons. Chapter 3 explores how input/output and part/whole distinctions were iterated and reiterated to help model distant future worlds in a portfolio of ‚ÄúSafety Case‚Äù evidence made to demonstrate the Olkiluoto repository‚Äôs safety to Finnish nuclear regulator STUK. Chapter 4 explores how Safety Case experts iterated and reiterated memories of a deceased predecessor figure in everyday engagements with deep time. What emerges are three insights about how futures attain discernible features ‚Äì insights about the ‚Äúcontinuity,‚Äù ‚Äúthinkability,‚Äù and ‚Äúextensibility‚Äù of expert thought ‚Äì that, I argue, can help twenty-first century experts better navigate not only deep time, but also unknown futures of nuclear technologies, planetary environment, and expertise itself.

IDNA has known detrimental effects on physical performance. Conversely, intense exercise training increases the risk of IDNA. While iron supplementation and aerobic exercise have been examined individually, the impact of simultaneous iron supplementation and aerobic training remains unclear. The goal of this study was to examine the individual and combined effects of supplementation (ferrous sulfate or a traditional Chinese herbal treatment, BaZhen KeLi, BZ) and/or aerobic training on iron status and physical performance.  One hundred and nine IDNA Chinese women participated in an 8-week randomized trial with a 3x2 factorial design. Treatments included 42 mg elemental iron/day, 150 g BZ/day, or a placebo and aerobic training (5 sessions/week of 25 minutes cycling) or no training. Iron status and physical performance were assessed at weeks 0, 4, and 8. Physical performance was measured as oxygen consumption at maximum exertion (VO2peak) and at the ventilatory threshold.  Training modified the serum ferritin response to iron supplementation. Both iron-supplemented groups improving in serum ferritin, but the iron-trained group had significantly lower serum ferritin than the iron-untrained group at week 8.  There were significant 2-way interactions between training and supplement for VO2peak and ventilatory threshold. These variables were significantly higher in the iron-trained, iron-untrained, and placebo-trained groups compared to the placebo-untrained group, with no significant differences among these three groups for either variable. BZ treatment did not significantly improve any measure of iron status compared to placebo. The BZ-trained group showed improvements in physical performance of equal magnitude to those of the iron- and placebo-trained groups. The BZ-untrained group showed no improvements in physical performance compared to the placebo-untrained group. Collectively, this dissertation concludes that regular aerobic training reduces the apparent efficacy of iron supplements in improving iron status. Additionally, iron supplementation taken without training improves endurance performance in sedentary women, while iron supplementation with simultaneous training provides no added benefit. Finally, prescribing BZ may not be advisable for improving iron status or physical performance in IDNA women.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:22Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) is the major metabolite of Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) present in mammalian milk. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dictates a maximum allowable concentration of 20 ¬µg/kg total aflatoxin in food and feed intended for dairy consumption, and 0.5 ¬µg/kg AFM1 in milk and milk products. The European Commission dictates a maximum allowable concentration of 4 ¬µg/kg total aflatoxin and 0.05 ¬µg/kg AFM1 respectively. The carry-over of AFB1 (the amount of AFB1 in the feed that is excreted as AFM1 in the milk) is a major factor used to create regulations for acceptable AFB1 concentrations in dairy cattle feed. It has been observed that higher producing dairy cows (30-40 kilograms of milk per day) have a higher carry-over rate, but current regulations use older studies using low-producing dairy cows (10-20 kilograms of milk per day) as a reference for risk. The objective of this project was to measure the carry-over rate of AFB1 from feed to AFM1 in the milk of modern, high-producing US Holsteins milked three times a day to provide a more relevant assessment for current regulations. Corn naturally infected with aflatoxin-producing fungi was used to imitate a real-world contamination scenario, an approach applied in only one previous study (Frobish et al., 1986). Three replications of a feeding trial to test carry-over in high-producing dairy cows were completed; each using 12 high-producing dairy cows in early- to mid-lactation, fed naturally contaminated corn meal top-dressed on their daily total mixed ration. Cows in each replication were assigned to: control (0 ¬µg/kg), low (10 ¬µg/kg), or high (20 ¬µg/kg) AFM1 groups. Feed and milk samples were taken for seven (replicates 1 and 2) or two (replicate 3) days and analyzed with a VICAM fluorometer. Using linear regression, the direct carry-over rate was 6.5%, much higher than the 1 to 2% estimated by previous researchers using low-producing dairy cows. These findings suggest that the US regulatory limit of 20 ¬µg/kg of total aflatoxin in the feed is not a guarantee of protection against violating the regulatory limit of 0.5 ¬µg/kg of AFM1 in milk of high-producing dairy cows.

In this thesis, we develop novel techniques to control these system-bath interactions and then demonstrate through experiments their significant influence on system properties and dynamics.  We develop a novel imaging technique in the context of ultracold lattice gases. This imaging technique allows us to tune the rate at which the atoms are measured (which can be thought of as an interaction with the electromagnetic radiation environment) over several orders of magnitude, without concomitant heating or loss of the atoms. Using this technical ability, we show that in the weak measurement limit, the atoms undergo unabated quantum evolution, i.e. they freely tunnel around the lattice, whereas as the measurement strength is increased, the tunnelling gets suppressed, the coherence is lost, and the atoms approach a classical limit of slower diffusion; demonstrating the influence of the degree of system-bath interactions on the system's dynamics. Moreover, the dissipation of open systems also allows for the realization of driven-dissipative phase transitions. We demonstrate and characterize such a phase transition in a system of ultrahigh-Q optomechanical Silicon Nitride membrane resonators, and then employ it to study the influence of system-bath interactions on criticality and phase transitions. In particular, we develop an active feedback protocol that allows us to change not only the strength of the resonators' interactions with the bath but also the very nature of their interactions (non-Markovian <i>vs</i> Markovian). We experimentally demonstrate that these can markedly influence the criticality of the driven-dissipative phase transition through measurements of critical and scaling exponents, which significantly change with changing system-bath interactions. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the very phases that the system supports can be influenced by the interactions &ndash; a class of non-Markovian interactions is shown to effect a phase, a nonequilibrium steady state, that has no analog in the Markovian case. Lastly, we consider a couple of applications of these resonator systems to enhance force-sensing capabilities. We also discuss the future prospects of such control techniques and other extensions of the works presented in this thesis for gaining further insights into the influence of system-bath interactions on system properties and behavior. <b>[1]</b> Nondestructive imaging of an ultracold lattice gas, Y.

However, what the development of these depressive symptoms implies for continued feelings of derailment remains in question. The present study investigated a potential feedback loop between depression and derailment to explain how these two phenomena may persist through time. College students (N = 939, 63.6% female) were asked to take part in a preregistered, 4-wave longitudinal study over the course of one academic year. An autoregressive latent trajectory model with structured residuals was developed to test the bidirectional associations of these variables at the within-person level, asking whether deviations from one‚Äôs mean trajectory on depression can predict downstream deviations from one‚Äôs mean trajectory on derailment and vice-versa. Depression and derailment evidenced significant autoregressive stability from one wave to the next, and significant positive covariation within most waves. Depression was found to significantly and positively predict later derailment across all cross-lagged components of the model, thus supporting the hypotheses of the present study. Derailment was found to significantly and negatively predict depression in two of the three cross-lagged components, thus failing to support the hypotheses of the present study. Given some of these unexpected findings, results are discussed with an eye toward future work uncovering potential moderators of the association between derailment and resultant depressive symptoms.

In animals, maternal choline supplementation (MCS) improves offspring behavior, but few studies have tested this in humans. In the present RCT, MCS caused higher placental and lower cord NR3C1 methylation, which is opposite the pattern associated with early adversity and offspring behavior problems in prior studies. We tested the independent associations between MCS and NR3C1 methylation and child behavior (BASC-III; n=21) at age 7, using adjusted linear regression.  Mothers consumed 480 or 930 mg choline/d during the 3rd trimester. Cord blood and placentas were collected at delivery for methylation analysis, which focused on average and site-specific NR3C1 methylation. The 930 mg group reported fewer emotional self-control problems. Cord CpG 30-32 methylation was associated with fewer internalizing and anxiety problems. Results suggest that choline-induced changes in NR3C1 methylation may have functional consequences for child behavior.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:39Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Several major groups of freshwater primary producers are rich in HUFAs while terrestrial primary producers contain little to no HUFAs, but do contain their molecular precursor. Unmet HUFA demand may lead to mismatches between animals and their resources, resulting in limitation. Studies suggest that HUFAs may to be essential nutrients for animals with access HUFA-rich resources while others appear to be efficient at synthesizing HUFAs from the molecular precursor. While HUFAs are considered essential for many freshwater animals, much less is known about the HUFA needs of wild animals in terrestrial ecosystems. Emerging freshwater insects may supply riparian predators with HUFAs, providing a crucial nutritional subsidy, but also making these consumers dependent upon freshwater HUFAs. After synthesizing the literature on HUFAs in natural ecosystems, I explored how HUFA availability in nature shapes consumer HUFAs requirements and use of subsidies in two species of riparian birds, Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) and Eastern Phoebes (Sayornis phoebe). In laboratory studies, I found that chicks of both species performed better on diets richer in HUFAs compared to diets richer in the HUFA precursor. In a field studies, I found that freshwater insects were significantly richer in HUFAs than were terrestrial insects. Freshwater insects provided Eastern Phoebes with HUFAs even when chicks consumed far more terrestrial than freshwater insects. In addition, while Eastern Phoebes consumed freshwater insects across the landscape, relative HUFA availability and other environmental factors had little effect on the degree to which they relied upon freshwater insect HUFA subsidies. Overall, this suggests that subsidies are likely to be important when there are major differences between the nutritional quality of local resources and of subsidies. My work indicates that HUFAs can be critically important in natural terrestrial ecosystems. HUFAs are a crucial dimension of food quality for developmental performance in two riparian avian insectivores. In addition, even when freshwater subsidies to riparian areas are relatively small, they can have profound impacts in nature as sources of critical nutrients that are scarce in terrestrial ecosystems.		12/4/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:24Z (GMT).

My field research analysis will focus on the surface water quality in three adjacent watersheds. The study objective was to determine baseline water quality in watersheds on the Crow Reservation prior to the development of a proposed coal mine site on tribal lands. All watersheds are located within the boundaries of the Crow Indian Reservation. The primary component of both watershed studies consists of an assessment of water quality of surface water originating on tribal lands. The objective of my field research is to determine a baseline assessment of surface water in watersheds prior to mine development, particularly on tribally owned and allotted tracts.
In addition, I will determine impacts to water quality from reclaimed coal mine spoils surface runoff and produced water discharge from coal bed methane wells within the watersheds. I will compare the water quality parameters from select undeveloped sites to developed sites within the watershed area. Several mines have been developed in areas downstream of the research site, immediately adjacent to tribal lands. Where the tributaries are still flowing, the surface water quality will be assessed and compared to the upstream baseline data. Historical data from state agencies will also be compared to data collected within watersheds on tribal lands. Analysis has shown the increasing degradation of water quality in watersheds downstream and across the state boundary of Montana into Wyoming where historical mining has occurred.
Water quantities affected by coalbed methane development will be outlined and compared to average annual precipitation in the region. Water rights are tied to the land ownership in both states. Where coal bed methane wells were developed, the water rights of receiving waters that would be impacted by direct discharge were quantified. All surface water in Montana was owned by energy companies, in Wyoming the majority of surface water rights where CBM wells were developed was owned by energy companies with a few fee land owners with water rights feeding irrigation canals. All natural resource development was facilitated through groundwater extraction. Had the wells discharged the allowable permitted flowrate of produced water every year, the discharged water would have significantly altered the flowrate of Youngs Creek. In Wyoming the produced water was permitted as beneficial use and discharged into waterways as livestock and irrigation supplies. Montana had changed its permitting requirements and has prohibited the direct discharge of produced water into waterways. Energy companies own the majority of the water rights in the downstream reaches of the watersheds where potential coal mines would be developed. Groundwater levels in coalbed aquifers within the affected watershed have been influenced by the development of coalbed methane wells on tracts adjacent to the tribal lands. Surface water quality has also been impacted by the direct discharge of produced water from coalbed methane wells into local drainages.
Finally, I will examine how tribal land tenure policy impacts water resource management on tribal lands. The Crow Tribe was recently granted reserved water rights and will now build and enforce a water code to manage its water resources. In order to enforce regulatory programs associated with the tribal water code, the tribal government will need to have the capacity to operate effective programs. This ability of the tribe to manage its resources represents a critical step toward self-determination and ultimately toward exercising tribal sovereignty. The successful implementation of the water code will affect resulting water quality in tribal communities as well as protect individual tribal member‚Äôs allottee land and water rights."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:28Z (GMT).

Most often presenting with drastic alterations in personality and behavior, as well as a gradual decline in language capabilities, FTLD is the second leading cause of early-onset dementia only after Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.  One of the major causes of familial FTLD is haploinsufficiency of the protein, progranulin (PGRN), resulting from mutation in the granulin (GRN) gene.  Interestingly, PGRN shows a dosage-dependent disease correlation, and GRN mutation resulting in complete loss of PGRN causes the lysosomal storage disease (LSD), neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL).  In this text, my co-workers and I demonstrate that PGRN is proteolytically processed in the lysosome into discrete granulin peptides, which may possess distinct functions.  We have independently found interactions between PGRN or granulin peptides and three lysosomal hydrolases: Cathepsin D (CTSD), glucocerebrosidase (GBA), and …ë-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (NAGA).  The activity of each of these enzymes was found to be reduced in Grn-/- mice, indicating that a potential mechanism of PGRN-related disease may be dysfunction of multiple lysosomal hydrolases.  In addition to possessing an indeterminate lysosomal function, PGRN has also been shown to be a neurotrophic factor.  Completion of a high-throughput screen searching for the receptor that mediates this function identified cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68) and neuropilin 2 (NRP2) as putative PGRN receptors. A second protein that has become of interest to the study of FTLD is TMEM106B.  Variants of TMEM106B have been associated with an increased risk of developing FTLD, especially in cases of GRN mutation (FTLD-GRN).  Although TMEM106B is known to be an endolysosomal transmembrane protein that regulates lysosomal morphology and degradative capacity, its exact function is unclear.  Our current findings suggest that TMEM106B may regulate cellular levels of the phosphoinositide, PI(3,5)P2.  In summary, our work supports a lysosomal role of the FTLD- and NCL-related protein, PGRN, and identifies a novel function of the FTLD risk factor, TMEM106B.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:24Z (GMT).

Due to the harsh climate changes and heavier traffic loads, bitumen tends to undergo rutting and cracking which severely limits its service life and durability. Bitumen-based binders containing various proportions of styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) triblock copolymer, crumb rubber (CR) and fumed nanosilica have been synthesized. The modified binders have been studied for rheological properties, storage stability, nanoparticle dispersion, and thermal resistance. In addition, binder-sand composites have been prepared in a binder/sand weight ratio of 1:9 and have been tested for three-point flexural bend tests. Addition of nanosilica dramatically improves the rheological properties of bitumen with enhancements as great as 400% and the compatibility between bitumen and polymers is enhanced. In addition, CR-modified bitumen demonstrates a similar level of performance as SBS-modified bitumen, when both are used synergistically with nanosilica, which leads to beneficial environmental and economic impacts. Finally, the interfacial mechanisms between bitumen, polymers and nanosilica that are responsible for modification of bitumen using Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) were investigated and correlated with the performance of the materials.

As such, Montaigne is seen to embody one of the most complex, unique, and critical forms of subjectivity: early-modern melancholic subjectivity, as it will be surveyed in this dissertation through a wide variety of literary and visual concepts and figures that engage and resonate with one other, to produce the ‚Äúworld‚Äù of early-modern melancholy, rather than just a psychological state. 
A reading of Montaigne‚Äôs Essais as a melancholic text will demonstrate the consistency and unity of a text famous for its heterogeneity and diversity. If these diverse parts of the Essais, ranging from cats to fathers, from honesty to cruelty, from the act of essaying to the critique of custom, from Montaigne‚Äôs views on passions to his views on death, can all be read and enveloped within [one] melancholy, then the implications are both that melancholy is not a pathology defined by lack, but rather a subjectivity, and moreover ‚Äî a privileged subjectivity, whose insight and critical abilities now parallel those of the ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù work of the Essais, as a work of immense complexity, singularity, value, and meaning."

These approaches have become attractive globally as routes for securing economically successful products and businesses. They also shape action and identity, producing new ways of being in the world and drawing adherents into an ever renewing process of imagining, building, and becoming.
While the entanglement of self and labour is central to the neoliberal entrepreneurial ethos, tech entrepreneurship and startups offer their own forms and entanglements that are informed by the materials, opportunities, and often utopian ideologies of technology development. In Jamaica, these are further shaped by, and give new expression to, existing technical practices and industrial histories, traditions of self-making, and the subjectivities of race, class, and gender that are unfolding within the island's transnationally-informed culture. I attend to the superpositions that result, paying particular attention to how questions of what, and who has value are expressed and shaped within and across the island's borders.
In Jamaica, as across the globe, there are now hubs of entrepreneurial activity modelled after images the Valley projects. I follow the moves of entrepreneurs as they search for collaboration, funding, and legitimisation through these programs, moving in transnational circuits that cut through Silicon Valley. While Jamaica is known in these circles, it is not understood as a site from which technology can be developed. I show how entrepreneurs work to cast themselves and the nation as capable, and how the island's understood culture operates as both blessing and burden within this effort. Despite the emancipatory rhetoric invested in today's tech entrepreneurialism, the largely black Jamaican entrepreneurs are faced with prejudices at home and abroad. I demonstrate how decisions about who counts as a valid tech entrepreneur and which methods they can employ are arbitrated along lines of colour and class. 
Finally, I argue against a reading of their work as a tropicalisation of things designed in more temperate climes. Jamaica has been interwoven into global capitalism since its discovery, and its resulting heterogeneity and ability to incorporate disparate and often incoherent forms destabilises notions of the indigenous or the authentic. Rather than drawing a line that unproblematically connects The Valley's ideas and The Island's actions ‚Äî California as metropole and Jamaica as the colony ‚Äî  I argue that a shift in perspective might allow us to see the their work as inherently and always modern, globally informed and future-focused in a way that the Valley has always claimed to be."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:29Z (GMT).

COPVs are currently used mainly in aerospace applications, such as storing the reserve oxygen on the International Space Station. Indeed a carbon/epoxy COPV failure caused the September 2016 explosion of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at Cape Canaveral, leading to more than a billion dollars of damage. Currently COPVs are used in relatively small numbers, but the day is rapidly approaching when they will be used in the millions in many aspects of daily life, particularly in automotive applications. 
My research seeks to better understand stress rupture and more accurately estimate the probability that a specific composite structure will fail in stress rupture. Prediction of a composite‚Äôs stress rupture behavior is heavily based on results from extensive testing, as there are not yet methods to predict a composite‚Äôs stress rupture behavior based on the component materials‚Äô properties. Testing results in comparatively small datasets of accelerated test data, which then must be extrapolated to predict a failure probability for a the service life of interest. This dissertation shows that the method used to analyze these datasets is crucial to accurately estimating the probability of a stress rupture failure, and also presents a data analysis method with lower variance and MSE estimates than current ad-hoc industry methods. Furthermore this dissertation compares current stress rupture models and derives a new, micromechanical stochastic stress rupture model."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:41Z (GMT).

These three efforts constitute stand-alone chapters. The first of these describes an alternative position and navigation system that estimates absolute aircraft position and velocity based on time-series of accumulated delta range measurements from Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) ground transponders. The second presents a method to mitigate multipath in GNSS signals that rely on an antenna array. The developed method can be used as part of an anti-spoofing system. The third discusses a novel radionavigation system based on passive reflectors in orbit and ground transmitters. The proposed system's ability to change the signal broadcast relatively easily in case the system comes under attack provides a robust navigation system.

Much CMC design research has focused on recreating features of face-to-face interaction or in capturing and transmitting rich information. In this thesis, I argue that a focus on rich interaction and rich information transmission overlooks many interesting situations and design choices when rich information is not necessarily beneficial.
More specifically, I explore how ephemeral media, which illuminate the alternative dimension of temporal preservation, particularly on the question of how long to retain content, and how a medium that de-emphasizes content, which highlights interaction rather than information, respectively influence the ways people interact with these tools. These explorations help inform a design space that includes other interesting dimensions such as the message materiality, interaction flow and system fidelity for CMC tools that designers have yet to fully explore. 
My approach to exploring this alternative design space is three-pronged. First, I think critically about the normative designs of CMC tools and consider alternatives to these designs, particularly digital ephemerality and content de-emphasis, as valuable sources for highlighting alternative purposes and goals users aim to achieve. Second, I conduct qualitative studies of users of a conventional CMC tool (Snapchat) and research prototype I have built (BubbleQ) to understand how these designs influence users‚Äô communicative practices. Third, I do iterative designs and evaluation of the prototype I built to advance designs from both my critical thinking and my study findings.
The first study showed that Snapchat‚Äôs ephemerality benefited communication by encouraging mundane interactions that support relationship maintenance between closer relations, reduce consciousness in self-presentation, and mitigate privacy violation issues in content saving and sharing. The second study shows that BubbleQ‚Äôs content de-emphasis design highlighted interaction rather than contents in messaging, leading to an alternative conversational flow that encouraged mundane and lightweight talk for social connection and helped highlight meanings in messages without explicit contents.
I use my findings to explore my two focal dimensions (temporal preservation and the focus on interaction rather than contents) more deeply. I also discuss the implications of formatively designing alternatives by assessing the materiality of digital messages, interaction flows that define the rhythm and speed of communication processes, and alternative levels of fidelity that violate the conventional emphasis on accuracy and genuineness of contents."

MAP infections have detrimental consequences for animal health and reduce dairy-herd productivity. Bacterial fastidiousness and slow generation time encumber diagnostic testing strategies. MAP is also a potential etiologic agent of human Crohn‚Äôs disease, with the bulk-milk supply serving as a possible transmission vector. The objective of this dissertation is to explore MAP infection dynamics on dairy farms, with an emphasis on the routes of bulk-milk contamination, transmission risk across production type, and the interplay between diagnostic testing outcomes. Accordingly, we have applied statistical and mathematical approaches to both cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets. 
Using questionnaire data from 292 U.S. dairies, we conducted a comparative risk assessment of organic vs. conventional management and determined that organic herds were at higher risk for new MAP infections. We concluded, empirically, that organic farms were more susceptible to a synergism of risk factors within the maternity pen and should improve calving-area hygiene if electing to permit cow-calf contact. Bulk-milk testing was also conducted for these herds. Most high ELISA tanks were PCR negative, implying that ELISA is not a perfect predictor of bulk-milk MAP status; for accurate risk assessment, bulk-milk ELISA should be used in tandem with PCR. A combination of ELISA and PCR may also aid in determining the specific route of bulk-milk contamination (either environmental or direct shedding). 
To extend the investigation to individual animals, longitudinal data were obtained from 14 MAP-positive cows in 2 low-prevalence herds. Robust relationships between culture, fecal qPCR, and milk ELISA were revealed, using mixed linear modeling to adjust for cow characteristics. We explored temporal relationships and observed that spikes in fecal shedding were predictive of subsequent high milk ELISA results. We also noted that disease ‚ÄúProgressors,‚Äù (infected animals with increasing fecal MAP CFU over time) had higher antibody titers overall. Interestingly, the paucity of positive milk samples, from both individual and bulk- tank sources, suggests that milk contamination is not a chief concern in low-prevalence herds. 
Armed with insights from these studies, in addition to published literature, we developed a mathematical model to explore the interaction between categories of infection, environmental MAP burden, and bulk-tank contamination. Direct shedding into milk accounted for < 1% of the MAP CFU in the tank, with environmental contamination from high shedders as the primary driver of bulk-milk MAP burden. Culling of high shedders, cleaning of the maternity pen, and adherence to milking parlor cleanliness each had a strong influence on lowering the bulk-milk MAP load. A combination of these initiatives served to drive the MAP level below an acceptable threshold (< 103 CFU/L). While complete elimination of MAP may be an unrealistic target for high-prevalence herds, the production of bulk milk with a low MAP load appears feasible. 
In this work, we assess the significance of a variety of contamination routes, transmission risks, and intervention strategies. These efforts are directed toward improved understanding of testing schemes and an ultimate refinement of control measures and milk quality programs. The conclusions from the studies presented in this dissertation may be applied to mitigate the spread of MAP in dairy herds, reduce prevalence, and lower or eliminate MAP in the bulk-milk supply."

The first three chapters are readings of speeches and scenes
informed by a focus on each character‚Äôs rhetorical goals and persuasive strategies. I concentrate particularly on passages in which characters invent, distort, and speak tendentiously in other ways. The final two chapters argue that the Vergilian narrator is misdirecting, because he uses untrue character speech to raise unfulfilled expectations, and that he is suppressive, because he leaves out much, and displaces the telling of much onto unreliable characters‚Äô claims. 
In the first chapter I examine how the reader perceives what characters in the Aeneid know, how the characters come to know, and how they use what they know. In the second chapter I interpret the diplomatic exchanges between Ilioneus and Latinus and between Aeneas
and Evander as rhetorical contests for advantage, informed by the chaotic military and political world that is Vergil‚Äôs Italy. In the third chapter I argue that the speech in the last four books shifts to disputing the responsibility for the outbreak of the war and the question of over what the war is being fought. In the fourth chapter I argue that the rhetorical strategies used by characters in the Aeneid to manipulate and persuade other characters are closely intertwined with the narrative strategies used by Vergil to misdirect the expectations of his readers. In the fifth chapter I suggest some broader effects on our understanding of the Aeneid that may follow from my readings of character speech and narrative technique in the first four chapters."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:30Z (GMT).

Surface plasmon enhanced catalysis is promising in harvesting light to drive chemical reactions that were otherwise inefficient or to bias the reaction pathways toward more desirable products. Catalytic hotspots at plasmonic hotspots is long predicted,
but experimentally observing it has been challenging, even though it is crucial for understanding the enhancement mechanism. Here, I define the correlations of the enhancement with the nanostructure geometry and local electric field enhancement, and show that the enhancement scales quadratically with the local actual light intensity, reflecting the involvement of plasmon-excitation induced hot electrons in the catalytic enhancement mechanism. This study demonstrates a methodology of applying correlated super-resolution microscopy and electron microscopy to study plasmonic nanocatalysts at the sub-particle level. The results reveal the intimate relation between the activity increase of metal nanocatalysts and local surface plasmon enhancement, demonstrating a long-predicted but hard-to-observe phenomenon in plasmon-enhanced catalysis.
In Chapter 4 and 5 of this thesis, I report both intraparticle and interparticle catalytic communication by analyzing the correlation between temporally subsequent reactions occurring at different locations within and among single nanocatalysts, resolved spatiotemporally using single-molecule fluorescence localization microscopy. This catalytic communication phenomenon, a first-of-its-kind discovery, occurs in three Pd or Au based nanocatalysts and in three distinct catalytic reactions including a photo-induced disproportionation reaction, an oxidative deacetylation reaction, and a reductive deoxygenation reaction. As the catalytic communications are phenomenologically similar and conceptually analogous to synergism in enzymes, which are nature‚Äôs most efficient catalysts, I envision that exploration of their generality and utility may bring new theoretical framework in understanding nanocatalysis."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:44Z (GMT).

Our overall goal was to assess key human host factors, including vitamin D and the gut microbiome, which affect this dual burden and have bi-directional effects on inflammation. Specifically, our objectives were to: 
1) assess the predictive performance of common anthropometric cut-offs utilized in diabetes population screening; 
2) examine the association between vitamin D and metabolic indicators; 
3) assess gut microbiota differences based on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) status; 
among a population with a high prevalence of suspected or confirmed active TB disease and low or normal body mass index (BMI).
Methods: At a rural hospital in South India, adult outpatients were enrolled after providing informed consent. Data collection included interviews, clinical examinations, anthropometry, and biological samples. Three study participant subsets were included in different analyses. Cornell University and the hospital institutional review boards approved study protocols.
Results: Most study participants had BMI <25 kg/m2 (88.2%) or waist circumference (WC) < diabetes screening cut-offs among South Asian populations (79.3%), which would be considered low risk in diabetes screening. However, one-third of study participants either had glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ‚â• 6.5% (12.3%) or between 5.7% and <6.5% (20.3%). BMI ‚â•25.0 kg/m2 demonstrated low sensitivity (0.21; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.35) as a screening indicator for HbA1c ‚â• 6.5%. Median 25(OH)D was 51.8 nmol/L (IQR 36.0-70.0). Serum 25(OH)D was inversely associated with glycated hemoglobin and WC (both p<0.05), respectively, though not hypertension or gut microbiota diversity (all p>0.05). Most bacterial sequences in rectal swab samples were from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla.
Conclusions: Our findings indicate a high prevalence of elevated HbA1c (‚â• 5.7%), and suggest the need for population-specific BMI and WC cut-offs in diabetes screening. Vitamin D status was associated with HbA1c, however not gut microbiome diversity. Further studies are needed to elucidate the potential roles of vitamin D and the gut microbiome in mitigating the dual burden of metabolic abnormalities and active TB disease among populations with low BMI in resource-limited settings."		12/18/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:31Z (GMT).

Meanwhile, the explosion of artificial intelligence requires massive data-heavy computation. Therefore, it is crucial to develop energy efficient computing from devices to architectures. This work is developed along three streams: a steep device with low operation voltage, a novel device enabling complex logic operation, and an efficient modeling algorithm to quickly incorporate emerging devices into circuit designs. On the first front, tunnel field effect transistors (TFETs), which switch by modulating quantum tunneling, promise sub-60 mV/dec subthreshold swing and operate at low power consumption. Based on the unique properties of atomically thin 2D layered materials, two-dimensional heterojunction interlayer tunneling field effect transistor (Thin-TFET) was proposed as a ultra-scaled steep transistor. On the second front, we converted the ‚Äúundesirable‚Äù ambipolar behavior in TFETs into XNOR logic operation, and proposed a one-transistor XNOR design: TransiXNOR. On the third front, we structured artificial neural networks with awareness of device physics, and developed an accurate, efficient, and generic device compact modeling algorithm: physics-inspired neural network (Pi-NN).		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:25Z (GMT).

This work addresses some issues for implementing GS in cassava. First, we evaluated multivariate and univariate GS models via prediction accuracies. Second, the genetic basis for DM content was investigated using the Regional Heritability Mapping (RHM) procedure. Lastly, the genetic basis for co-inheritance of DM, root color and fresh yield (FYLD) were investigated using the Regional co-heritability Mapping (RHM) procedure. Key lessons were: (1) Multitrait (MT) models for single location data offered 40% higher average prediction accuracies for genomic breeding values (GEBVs) of six target traits across 3 locations compared to single-trait (uT) models. (2) Multivariate multi-environment (ME) models also offered 12% higher average prediction accuracies compared to a compound symmetric multi-environment model (uE) parameterized as a univariate multi-kernel model for multi-year multi-environment data. (3) The RHM analysis identified segments associated with DM in white cassava on chromosomes 1, 4, 5, 10, 17,18 and on yellow cassava chromosome 1. Candidates extracted from genes adjacent to the RHM significant segments include: glycosyltransferases, serine-threonine kinases (SnRKs), invertases and fructose bisphosphate aldolase. Prediction accuracies from these candidates and all genes in the RHM significant regions suggest that they may be tagging regions associated with DM. (4) Genome-wide segment correlations from the RcHM analysis in yellow cassava showed a limited prospect for high DM yellow cassava development but good prospects for high DM, high yielding white cassava development.

A longstanding goal in evolution and ecology is to document patterns of biodiversity and infer the biological processes that contribute to speciation and phenotypic evolution. Here, I take a multidimensional approach to examine the tempo, mode, and mechanisms of phenotypic evolution and speciation in birds. I first document a positive association between rates of vocal evolution and speciation in two large lineages in Neotropical birds. I then explore phenotypic and genetic variation in two lineages of songbirds: the White-collared Seedeater (Sporophila torqueola) and the Holarctic redpoll finches (Acanthis sp.). Finally, I quantify phenotypic change in Horned Lark of the Imperial Valley in southern California, where the desert has been transformed into agricultural land. Collectively, these studies provide different perspectives on avian biodiversity and together illustrate the immense value of natural history collections as repositories of phenotypic and genetic data.		12/18/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:45Z (GMT).

The measurement is performed using data collected by the CMS experiment during the 2016 data-taking period, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. The measurement is performed using events where one top quark decays hadronically and is reconstructed as a single large-radius t jet with pt > 400 GeV, while the other top quark decays leptonically to a b jet, an electron or a muon, and a neutrino. Jet substructure techniques are used to identify the large-radius jet as a t jet candidate. The measurement demonstrates that current simulations overpredict the rate of top quark pair production at high pt, providing valuable feedback on the accuracy of current simulation.

In addition to standard corporate governance measures like setting up boards of directors and convening shareholders meetings, many business-owning families have also begun applying rule-based structures and procedures to regulate relationships between family members. Following the recommendations of consultants belonging to a newly emerging field of family business expertise, these Colombian business-owning families write out what they refer to as ‚Äúfamily protocols,‚Äù and gather in ‚Äúfamily assemblies,‚Äù where they work specifically toward the continuity of their family businesses. 
Based on twenty months of ethnographic field research among members of such families in Bogot√°, Colombia, this dissertation explores how family business governance and the idea of successful succession create bonds of kinship among family shareholders. Specifically, I argue that the procedures of governance and the notions of efficacy that consultant recommendations involve, provide family members with a means to enact family identities that are closely associated with obligations to work. For individuals who are descendants of notable entrepreneurs and understand themselves as having inherited their unique disposition for success, expert-endorsed measures present tangible ways to take family relationships into their own hands. As such, I argue that in this context, kinship is re-created alongside family governance, and not necessarily as a result of it. In other words, it is the idea that family business can be sustained through concerted action, combined with ideologies of genealogy and of expertise, that continue to bring together shareholders to interact as family. 
Drawing from anthropological accounts that disrupt notions of expertise based on efficacy, this study of the role of expert knowledge in the production of kinship among Colombian business-owning families contributes to the ongoing effort in anthropology to elucidate the contingent constitution of relatedness. In this case, a close engagement with how family business successful succession motivates specific forms of agency presents kinship as an unexpected effect of business expertise. In addition, by presenting the enactment of family as an unintended consequence of the ideas and techniques of consultants rather than as their direct result, the dissertation provides a framework in which to consider a fuller picture of concerted action in the world of business."

Recent advancements in commercial security architectures such as Intel SGX have garnered much attention. The promise of these architectures is compelling; because the root of trust lies in hardware, the system it protects remains secure even if low-level software such as the operating system is compromised. Unfortunately, hardware is itself complex and error-prone ‚Äì software-exploitable vulnerabilities in SGX have already been found, and bugs in hardware have a long history of causing security vulnerabilities. Even if hardware is correct in the conventional sense that it conforms to a specification, security is not assured. Processors still leak secrets through microarchitectural timing channels, and virtually every hardware feature that improves performance has been exploited to leak secrets. Information flow security is a promising approach for verifying hardware systems. Information flow tracks and constrains the movement of data throughout a system ensuring that confidentiality and integrity are not violated. Information flow control can be enforced by a type system embedded in a secure hardware description language (HDL) with which the hardware is described. With this approach, the HDL includes features for describing security policies. The type system of the HDL then statically proves at design-time that the security policies are always enforced. This thesis enables future hardware designs to provide strong assurance through information flow control. This is achieved through two major thrusts of research: 1) developing a practical, expressive hardware description language for enforcing information flow control in hardware designs and 2) designing secure hardware that is suitable for information flow verification. In particular, this thesis describes a number of contributions to secure HDLs that were implemented as extensions to a secure HDL called SecVerilog. It also describes ChiselFlow, a variant of the HDL, Chisel, for information flow security. This thesis studies the application of secure HDLs to a prototype implementation of a commercial security architecture, ARM TrustZone. A novel architecture for information flow security called HyperFlow is presented to improve upon the shortcomings of TrustZone by providing more general security policies, constraining information release, and defending against timing-channel attacks. A second novel architecture called Timing Compartments extends HyperFlow to defend against timing-channel attacks in a multicore processor. A novel memory scheduling algorithm for preventing timing channel attacks in a shared memory controller is presented to improve performance. Overall, this thesis demonstrates that HDL-level information flow control is capable of securing usable and performant hardware designs.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:27Z (GMT).

Inland and coastal populations of the North American swamp sparrow (Melospiza georgiana) have become an emerging model system for studies of natural selection because they are morphologically and behaviorally distinct despite a very recent divergence time (<15,000 years), yet common garden experiments have demonstrated a genetic basis for their differences. I characterized genomic patterns of variation within and between inland and coastal swamp sparrows via reduced representation sequencing and demonstrated that background genomic differentiation (FST=0.02) and divergence (Œ¶ST=0.05) between these populations is very low, rendering signatures of natural selection highly detectable (max FST=0.8). I then sequenced and assembled a de novo reference genome for the species and conducted a scan for genes involved in coastal adaptation, particularly the evolution of a deeper bill, darker plumage, and tolerance for salinity. I recovered a multigenic snapshot of adaptation via robust signatures of selection at 31 genes. As in Darwin‚Äôs finches, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling appears responsible for changes in bill depth, a putative magic trait for ecological speciation. Genes for salinity tolerance constituted the majority of candidates (23/31), including genes involved in regulating osmotic balance via vasoconstriction and intracellular vesicle trafficking. I then quantified genotype-phenotype associations in a naturally occurring hybrid zone between inland and coastal swamp sparrows and demonstrated that melanism in coastal swamp sparrows is a product of both direct positive selection and molecular ‚Äúspandrel‚Äù effects. Black plumage patches are the product of intrasexual selection on a melanin-specific transcription factor (BNC2), whereas black legs are a pleiotropic consequence of selection on a vesicle trafficking gene involved in salt tolerance (BLOC1S2). Pleiotropic effects of vesicle trafficking may therefore explain why other salt marsh birds, snakes and mammals have also evolved darker coloration in a phenomenon known as ‚Äúsalt marsh melanism‚Äù. Natural selection has therefore driven genetic, ecological and phenotypic divergence in the swamp sparrow, and possibly other locally adapted salt marsh lineages, through a combination of direct and indirect molecular mechanisms.

Injurious loading, however, can upset this balance, inducing cartilage‚Äôs chondrocyte cells to dysfunction and leading to both the degradation of the tissue and, ultimately, the debilitating joint disease osteoarthritis. Understanding how injury causes dysfunction is important not only for understanding disease pathogenesis, but also for targeting treatments to protect and preserve cartilage. Previous studies have explored both the mechanical and biological deterioration of cartilage after injury, observing cracks in the extracellular matrix and a complex wave of cellular responses, including respiratory dysfunction and death. However, many open questions remain regarding the link between injury mechanics and cartilage dysfunction. In the first part of this thesis, I explore the spatiotemporal evolution of cellular dysfunction after impact injury in order to relate this dysfunction to the mechanics of injury and elucidate promising therapeutic targets. First, I present a custom impact device to injure cartilage explants while interfacing with microscopy. Analyzing such imaging data, I found that injury induces a wave of mitochondrial dysfunction within 15 minutes of impact and cell death within 3 hours. Both measures are highly correlated with the local strain experienced during injury, showing that injury mechanics dictate peracute cellular dysfunction. Consequently, cartilage‚Äôs compliant surface layer may serve to protect underlying cells by absorbing excess strain. Remarkably, I also found that treating samples with the mitoprotective peptide SS-31 completely eliminated the strain-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction after impact. These results have important clinical implications for understanding the very first changes in cartilage after injury and targeting these responses with clinically-relevant treatment. In the next part of this thesis, I explore one commonly-observed form of mechanical deterioration induced by cartilage injury: cracks. In particular, I present a method to indent cartilage with a sharp blade while simultaneously tracking bulk and local mechanics. Results showed significant dependence across physiologically relevant rates and were modified by cartilage‚Äôs layered structure. Taken together, this study highlights the importance of rate and inhomogeneity in governing cartilage failure and suggests important parallels between failure in cartilage and in high-toughness double-network hydrogels. Finally, I close by exploring spatiotemporal mechanics and indentation failure in an entirely new system: protective glass coatings. Tracking embedded fiducial markers in polymeric coatings with rapid 3D confocal videos, I show that incorporating nanosilica beads in the coatings modulates their adhesion and indentation response, with important implications for their ability to protect the underlying glass. Overall, this thesis champions the utility of imaging in concert with spatiotemporal analysis in order to relate the complex mechanical behavior of a system, such as articular cartilage, to its function and dysfunction.

This dissertation focuses on molecular mechanisms governing the interfacial behavior of 2D materials and related molecular analogs. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the interfacial molecular mechanisms used for 2D macromolecules. Chapter 2 looks into the detailed mechanisms and control of functional molecules‚Äô absorption on graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. Chapter 3 builds a tool to understand how surface organic monolayers manipulate the adhesion of graphene. Chapter 4 explores reversible cohesive mechanisms in 2D synthetic networks using macrocyclic analogs that stack into high aspect ratio, lyotropic nanotubes. This dissertation ends with a complex interface between GO and cell surfaces in Chapter 5 to discuss how GO nanosheets stimulate biological cells and find potential in cancer therapeutics. These results empower adhesive engineering, stacking control, and therapeutics design of 2D materials and related molecular networks.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:35Z (GMT).

This interaction has led to the development of the innate immune system, which is responsible for defending the host from a wide range of pathogens. As pathogens evolve to compromise host immunity, immune genes rapidly counter-evolve. In this dissertation, I present studies that answer how the innate immune system of Drosophila responds to a variety of pathogens and how host-pathogen interactions may have shaped the evolution of host cellular immunity. In Chapter 2, I explore how an arms race between Drosophila and its pathogens may have led to selective sweeps and adaptive evolution in the Drosophila cellular immune system. In Chapter 3, I present work on how host responses to infection with various bacteria are crucial in host survival and homeostasis. In Chapter 4, I investigate the role of genes that are expressed in a coordinated manner upon infection and identify key genes for future functional genetic studies. Altogether, these studies provide a clearer mechanistic and population genetic understanding of host-pathogen interactions and Drosophila immunity.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:36Z (GMT).

cell phones to ultra-large television panels. Amorphous silicon (a-
Si) has been the industry workhorse as the active semiconductor in pixeladdressing
transistors due to its uniformity and low production costs. However,
a-Si can no longer support larger and higher-resolution displays, and new materials
with higher electron mobilities are required. Amorphous indium gallium
zinc oxide (a-IGZO), which retains the uniformity and low cost of amorphous
films, has emerged as a viable candidate due to its enhanced transport properties.
However, a-IGZO devices suffer from long-term instabilities‚Äîthe origins
of which are not yet fully understood‚Äîcausing a drift in switching characteristics
over time and affecting product lifetime. More recently, devices fabricated
from textured nanocrystalline IGZO, termed c-axis aligned crystalline (CAAC),
have demonstrated superior stability. Unfortunately, little is known regarding
the phase formation and crystallization kinetics of either the CAAC structure or
in the broader ternary IGZO system.
Crystallinity and texture of CAAC IGZO films deposited by RF reactive
sputtering were studied and characterized over a wide range of deposition conditions.
The characteristic CAAC (0 0 9) peak at 2 = 30 was observed by X-ray
diffraction, and nanocrystalline domain texture was determined using a general
area detector diffraction system (GADDS). Highly ordered CAAC films were
obtained near the InGaZnO4 composition at a substrate temperature of 310C
and in a 10%O2/90% Ar sputtering ambient. High-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) confirmed the formation of CAAC and identified 2‚Äì
3 nm domains coherently aligned over large ranges extending beyond the field
of view (15 nm  15 nm). Cross-section HRTEM of the CAAC/substrate interface
shows formation of an initially disordered IGZO layer prior to CAAC
formation, suggesting a nucleation mechanism similar to ZnO thin films. A
classical nucleation and growth model is proposed and compared to alternative
models proposed in literature.
Extending this study of CAAC IGZO, the formation and growth of crystalline
IGZO over a wide composition range and processing conditions were
explored. IGZO itself is one composition of a class of homologous structures
in the pseudo-binary InGaO3(ZnO)m system. For integer m, the equilibrium
structure is known and well-characterized; however, for non-integer m, disorder
must exist and the kinetics of the structural development remain almost
completely unknown. A high-throughput (combinatorial) approach utilizing
co-sputter deposition, millisecond timescale thermal gradient laser annealing,
and spatially-resolved characterization using microbeam wide-angle X-ray scattering
was used to probe the structural evolution as a function of temperature,
time, and composition. As-deposited films were amorphous in the InGaO3-
rich composition range, becoming crystalline (wurtzite) with increasing ZnO
content. Under millisecond heating, films evolved toward the equilibrium layered
structure consisting of nearly pure In2O3 layers with (Ga, Zn)Ox interlayers.
Composition deviations (non-integer m) are discussed within a model of
cationic disorder in both the In2O3 layers and the (Ga, Zn)Ox layers. Crystal-tocrystal
transformations in the high-ZnO region are discussed within the context
of a new growth model for these homologous structures. This deeper understanding
of the nature of crystalline IGZO will help to enable the successful
implementation of CAAC IGZO for high-performance display applications."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:33Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Following ligand binding, the type I receptors are phosphorylated by the type II receptors on the cell surface. Then activated type I receptors phosphorylate and release the receptor mediated Smads (R-Smads), which subsequently complex with common mediator Smad (co-Smad) and shuttle into the nucleus to regulate target gene transcription. The BMP pathway plays multiple important roles in regulating development and tissue homeostasis. Abnormalities of the BMP signaling pathway are often associated with physiological disorders and diseases in human, which include, but are not limited to, skeleton diseases, cardiovascular disorders and cancers. Thus it is important to ensure tight regulations of BMP signaling. The Liu lab uses C. elegans as a model system to investigate regulations of a BMP-like signaling pathway. Using a genetic screen highly specific to the BMP pathway, many novel modulators of the pathway have been identified that function at the ligand-receptor level. Among them are two paralogous tetraspanins, TSP-12 and TSP-14, the netrin receptor UNC- 40/Neogenin, and the RGM protein DRAG-1. However, how these new players interact with the ligand-receptor complex or with other cell surface modulators to regulate BMP signaling is not fully understood. SUP-17/ADAM10 belongs to the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family of transmembrane proteins that are known for cleaving many membrane and membrane-associated proteins through ‚Äòectodomain shedding‚Äô. In this thesis, I reveal that SUP-17/ADAM10 is expressed and functions in the signal receiving cells to regulate BMP signaling. Endogenously tagged SUP-17 is localized both to the cell surface and to intracellular vesicles. In embryos, null mutations in tsp-12, but not in tsp-14, cause decreased SUP-17 localization at the cell surface, and show increased accumulated localization in early and late endosomes. TSP-12 may also facilitate the cleavage of SUP-17‚Äôs pro-domain in gravid adults. Using genetic approaches, I identified UNC-40/Neogenin as one of the substrates of SUP-17 in BMP signaling. Using western blotting, I generated preliminary evidence suggesting that the endogenous UNC-40 may be cleaved by SUP-17, and that there is a slight increase in steady state protein level of UNC-40 in adult tsp-12(0) mutants and a decrease in drag-1(0) mutants. These results suggested a model for how these BMP modulators may function to regulate BMP signaling: tetraspanins TSP-12 and TSP-14 regulate the cell surface localization and maturation of SUP-17/ADAM10, which in turn cleaves UNC-40/neogenin and other proteins to regulate the signaling pathway. Future work will be needed to identify the additional substrates of SUP-17/ADAM10 in the BMP pathway.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:37Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) is the major metabolite of Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) present in mammalian milk. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dictates a maximum allowable concentration of 20 ¬µg/kg total aflatoxin in food and feed intended for dairy consumption, and 0.5 ¬µg/kg AFM1 in milk and milk products. The European Commission dictates a maximum allowable concentration of 4 ¬µg/kg total aflatoxin and 0.05 ¬µg/kg AFM1 respectively. The carry-over of AFB1 (the amount of AFB1 in the feed that is excreted as AFM1 in the milk) is a major factor used to create regulations for acceptable AFB1 concentrations in dairy cattle feed. It has been observed that higher producing dairy cows (30-40 kilograms of milk per day) have a higher carry-over rate, but current regulations use older studies using low-producing dairy cows (10-20 kilograms of milk per day) as a reference for risk. The objective of this project was to measure the carry-over rate of AFB1 from feed to AFM1 in the milk of modern, high-producing US Holsteins milked three times a day to provide a more relevant assessment for current regulations. Corn naturally infected with aflatoxin-producing fungi was used to imitate a real-world contamination scenario, an approach applied in only one previous study (Frobish et al., 1986). Three replications of a feeding trial to test carry-over in high-producing dairy cows were completed; each using 12 high-producing dairy cows in early- to mid-lactation, fed naturally contaminated corn meal top-dressed on their daily total mixed ration. Cows in each replication were assigned to: control (0 ¬µg/kg), low (10 ¬µg/kg), or high (20 ¬µg/kg) AFM1 groups. Feed and milk samples were taken for seven (replicates 1 and 2) or two (replicate 3) days and analyzed with a VICAM fluorometer. Using linear regression, the direct carry-over rate was 6.5%, much higher than the 1 to 2% estimated by previous researchers using low-producing dairy cows. These findings suggest that the US regulatory limit of 20 ¬µg/kg of total aflatoxin in the feed is not a guarantee of protection against violating the regulatory limit of 0.5 ¬µg/kg of AFM1 in milk of high-producing dairy cows.

In this work, the spectral reflectance and transmittance of soil are examined. The experiments lead to possible physical explanations for the spectral and directional features of reflectance spectra, and the results suggest how optical and proximal remote sensing might be useful in observations of soil moisture content. The first experiment considered the change in spectral reflectance of soil samples during evaporative drying. The water absorption band depths at 970 nm and 1160 nm, in near infrared, decreased monotonically as the water content decreased, but they were not detectable in all samples; these water absorption bands will not be generally useful for observing surface soil moisture. In contrast, the band depths of the 1440 nm and 1930 nm absorption features were very responsive to the water content over the entire drying cycle. The change in band depth at 1930 nm was particularly interesting since the direction of the change reversed simultaneous with soil water evaporation rate change. A simple mathematical model suggests that the pattern of change in the band depth is related to the near extinction of light at the band center relative to the band shoulders. The second experiment examined the degree to which light transmitted through quartz sand samples would maintain any directional characteristics. Transmittance decreased monotonically as the illumination angle increase, but slowly at all wavelengths. This indicates that directional radiation transmitted through the sand layer becomes diffuse with a millimeters-thin sand layer. For the saturated samples, the influence of water on light transmittance in the VNIR (350-1300 nm) was the reverse of that in the SWIR (1330-2500 nm) wavelength region. In the VNIR, transmittance increased in the saturated sample relative to the dry sample, while transmittance decreased sharply after 1330 nm, with obvious spectral features characteristic of water absorption. Analysis of transmittance by quartz sand samples suggests that most of the directional variation due to the change in illumination angle can be attributed to surface reflective loss. The implication is that the directional reflection may be treated as a surface phenomenon, with the volume reflectance contributing a diffuse component. The third experiment considered directional spectral reflectance of soil samples under dry and saturated conditions. When the samples were dry, the directional reflectance changed obviously with the phase angle, showing a stronger backward reflectance, while the forward reflectance was generally lower. For saturated soil samples, the directional characteristics of spectral reflectance apparent with dry soil were substantially reduced. In particular, the strong backward scattering weakened. Instead, the directional spectral reflectance became less sensitive to changes in both the illumination angle and the observation angle, especially for dark soils. Added water not only darkened the soil reflectance, but also eliminated the directional differences. This would make it difficult to discern soil structural properties when the soil moisture content is high.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:38Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, what the development of these depressive symptoms implies for continued feelings of derailment remains in question. The present study investigated a potential feedback loop between depression and derailment to explain how these two phenomena may persist through time. College students (N = 939, 63.6% female) were asked to take part in a preregistered, 4-wave longitudinal study over the course of one academic year. An autoregressive latent trajectory model with structured residuals was developed to test the bidirectional associations of these variables at the within-person level, asking whether deviations from one‚Äôs mean trajectory on depression can predict downstream deviations from one‚Äôs mean trajectory on derailment and vice-versa. Depression and derailment evidenced significant autoregressive stability from one wave to the next, and significant positive covariation within most waves. Depression was found to significantly and positively predict later derailment across all cross-lagged components of the model, thus supporting the hypotheses of the present study. Derailment was found to significantly and negatively predict depression in two of the three cross-lagged components, thus failing to support the hypotheses of the present study. Given some of these unexpected findings, results are discussed with an eye toward future work uncovering potential moderators of the association between derailment and resultant depressive symptoms.

Current autonomous vehicles that provide motion safety guarantees exhibit excessively conservative driving behavior when operating in road environments containing highly dynamic obstacles. In this thesis we present a contingency-based motion planning framework for autonomous road vehicles. Probabilistic state predictions are generated for each discrete action of nearby obstacle vehicles, and multiple contingency trajectories are planned such that safe execution is possible under each possible discrete action. An online estimation algorithm is used to infer the discrete obstacle action from sensor observations and inform execution-time contingency selection. We present a fast upper bound on a metric of distinguishability that approximates the predicted probability of correctly identifying the discrete action of an obstacle from a set of possible hypotheses. The metric is used to optimize expected execution cost and safety of a set of contingency trajectories. Simulated experiments show that the proposed planning framework produces trajectories with a lower cost and stronger safety guarantees than that of prior work, and this performance improvement persists across a range of vehicle and obstacle initial conditions.
Additionally, a prototype system architecture for a verifiably secure autonomous vehicle is presented. The system architecture is designed to enforce separation of trusted and untrusted information flows. A map verification algorithm is used to verify external data coming from an untrusted source. Motion planning and map verification software components are developed with existing tools that enforce information flow control at the language level. The architecture is implemented on a mobile robotic testbed and experiments are performed to simulate a remote attack scenario. Experimental results show that the architecture is resistant to malicious external data, and can operate safely even when external communications are compromised. Analogies are drawn between the prototype architecture and hardware and software components on real-world autonomous vehicles."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:35Z (GMT).

My field research analysis will focus on the surface water quality in three adjacent watersheds. The study objective was to determine baseline water quality in watersheds on the Crow Reservation prior to the development of a proposed coal mine site on tribal lands. All watersheds are located within the boundaries of the Crow Indian Reservation. The primary component of both watershed studies consists of an assessment of water quality of surface water originating on tribal lands. The objective of my field research is to determine a baseline assessment of surface water in watersheds prior to mine development, particularly on tribally owned and allotted tracts.
In addition, I will determine impacts to water quality from reclaimed coal mine spoils surface runoff and produced water discharge from coal bed methane wells within the watersheds. I will compare the water quality parameters from select undeveloped sites to developed sites within the watershed area. Several mines have been developed in areas downstream of the research site, immediately adjacent to tribal lands. Where the tributaries are still flowing, the surface water quality will be assessed and compared to the upstream baseline data. Historical data from state agencies will also be compared to data collected within watersheds on tribal lands. Analysis has shown the increasing degradation of water quality in watersheds downstream and across the state boundary of Montana into Wyoming where historical mining has occurred.
Water quantities affected by coalbed methane development will be outlined and compared to average annual precipitation in the region. Water rights are tied to the land ownership in both states. Where coal bed methane wells were developed, the water rights of receiving waters that would be impacted by direct discharge were quantified. All surface water in Montana was owned by energy companies, in Wyoming the majority of surface water rights where CBM wells were developed was owned by energy companies with a few fee land owners with water rights feeding irrigation canals. All natural resource development was facilitated through groundwater extraction. Had the wells discharged the allowable permitted flowrate of produced water every year, the discharged water would have significantly altered the flowrate of Youngs Creek. In Wyoming the produced water was permitted as beneficial use and discharged into waterways as livestock and irrigation supplies. Montana had changed its permitting requirements and has prohibited the direct discharge of produced water into waterways. Energy companies own the majority of the water rights in the downstream reaches of the watersheds where potential coal mines would be developed. Groundwater levels in coalbed aquifers within the affected watershed have been influenced by the development of coalbed methane wells on tracts adjacent to the tribal lands. Surface water quality has also been impacted by the direct discharge of produced water from coalbed methane wells into local drainages.
Finally, I will examine how tribal land tenure policy impacts water resource management on tribal lands. The Crow Tribe was recently granted reserved water rights and will now build and enforce a water code to manage its water resources. In order to enforce regulatory programs associated with the tribal water code, the tribal government will need to have the capacity to operate effective programs. This ability of the tribe to manage its resources represents a critical step toward self-determination and ultimately toward exercising tribal sovereignty. The successful implementation of the water code will affect resulting water quality in tribal communities as well as protect individual tribal member‚Äôs allottee land and water rights."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:48Z (GMT).

Due to the harsh climate changes and heavier traffic loads, bitumen tends to undergo rutting and cracking which severely limits its service life and durability. Bitumen-based binders containing various proportions of styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) triblock copolymer, crumb rubber (CR) and fumed nanosilica have been synthesized. The modified binders have been studied for rheological properties, storage stability, nanoparticle dispersion, and thermal resistance. In addition, binder-sand composites have been prepared in a binder/sand weight ratio of 1:9 and have been tested for three-point flexural bend tests. Addition of nanosilica dramatically improves the rheological properties of bitumen with enhancements as great as 400% and the compatibility between bitumen and polymers is enhanced. In addition, CR-modified bitumen demonstrates a similar level of performance as SBS-modified bitumen, when both are used synergistically with nanosilica, which leads to beneficial environmental and economic impacts. Finally, the interfacial mechanisms between bitumen, polymers and nanosilica that are responsible for modification of bitumen using Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) were investigated and correlated with the performance of the materials.

These approaches have become attractive globally as routes for securing economically successful products and businesses. They also shape action and identity, producing new ways of being in the world and drawing adherents into an ever renewing process of imagining, building, and becoming.
While the entanglement of self and labour is central to the neoliberal entrepreneurial ethos, tech entrepreneurship and startups offer their own forms and entanglements that are informed by the materials, opportunities, and often utopian ideologies of technology development. In Jamaica, these are further shaped by, and give new expression to, existing technical practices and industrial histories, traditions of self-making, and the subjectivities of race, class, and gender that are unfolding within the island's transnationally-informed culture. I attend to the superpositions that result, paying particular attention to how questions of what, and who has value are expressed and shaped within and across the island's borders.
In Jamaica, as across the globe, there are now hubs of entrepreneurial activity modelled after images the Valley projects. I follow the moves of entrepreneurs as they search for collaboration, funding, and legitimisation through these programs, moving in transnational circuits that cut through Silicon Valley. While Jamaica is known in these circles, it is not understood as a site from which technology can be developed. I show how entrepreneurs work to cast themselves and the nation as capable, and how the island's understood culture operates as both blessing and burden within this effort. Despite the emancipatory rhetoric invested in today's tech entrepreneurialism, the largely black Jamaican entrepreneurs are faced with prejudices at home and abroad. I demonstrate how decisions about who counts as a valid tech entrepreneur and which methods they can employ are arbitrated along lines of colour and class. 
Finally, I argue against a reading of their work as a tropicalisation of things designed in more temperate climes. Jamaica has been interwoven into global capitalism since its discovery, and its resulting heterogeneity and ability to incorporate disparate and often incoherent forms destabilises notions of the indigenous or the authentic. Rather than drawing a line that unproblematically connects The Valley's ideas and The Island's actions ‚Äî California as metropole and Jamaica as the colony ‚Äî  I argue that a shift in perspective might allow us to see the their work as inherently and always modern, globally informed and future-focused in a way that the Valley has always claimed to be."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:51Z (GMT).

This is an important question because local and society-wide institutional environments concurrently shape organizational behavior. Building on the theory of political mediation and an institutional perspective, we argue that state-level sociopolitical influences on organizations will depend on the broader regulatory context at the federal level. We use data on coal-fired facilities‚Äô sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions to address the question of when formal and informal local (state-level) sociopolitical contexts directly influence organizations‚Äô environmental performance. Our results show that when the national-level Acid Rain Program (ARP) was regarded as an effective regulation for controlling SO2 emissions (2003‚Äì2009), coal-fired facilities, as well as local government officials, key stakeholders, and social movement organizations (SMOs), attended to the implementation of the federal law. As a consequence, local sociopolitical contexts had a negligible effect on SO2 emissions by individual facilities. However, when stakeholders questioned the effectiveness of the ARP (2010‚Äì2011), the direct impact of SMOs and other sociopolitical contexts at the state level on facilities‚Äô emissions increased. From an institutional perspective, our results imply that local sociopolitical contexts are themselves embedded within the larger, society-wide, institutional environment, and that evaluating the direct influence of local sociopolitical pressures on organizations thus requires a more dynamic approach that includes consideration of institutional contexts at different levels in society.

There has been a lively debate in the literature regarding whether valence or arousal is the primary cause of mood-dependent FM.  Because much past research has not effectively disentangled valence from arousal, the present studies used a new mood manipulation that allowed valence and arousal to be controlled and their associated retrieval processes to be measured.  In Experiment 1, low-arousal negative moods reduced false memory compared to positive and neutral moods by increasing verbatim memory traces, confirming the prediction that valence can influence false memory independent of arousal.  In Experiment 2, low-arousal negative moods reduced false memory for both list lengths, but the processes associated with false memory for short lists were not the same as the processes associated with false memory for long lists.  High arousal negative moods in Experiment 3 now increased false memory compared to neutral moods‚Äîbut still reduced false memory compared to positive moods‚Äîwhich suggested that high arousal increased false memory compared to low arousal. .Experiment 4 provided a direct test of arousal‚Äôs effect on false memory and confirmed that higher levels of arousal increase false memory via strong gist traces, regardless of valence.  The results were discussed in support of fuzzy-trace theory‚Äîbut not affect-as-information theory‚Äîand practical applications to the law were noted.

The objectives of the experiments presented in Section II were: evaluating the reproductive performance, herd exit dynamics, lactation performance, and profitability of dairy cows managed with different duration of the voluntary waiting period and methods of submission for first service. 
The studies presented in Section I demonstrated that the sensitivity of the HIS to identify cows with health issues was high for metabolic and digestive disorders (93%) and moderate for cases of clinical mastitis (55%) and metritis (55%). Among mastitis cases, HIS was effective for identifying cows with mastitis caused by Escherichia coli (80.7%), but it was less effective in identifying cows with mastitis caused by other pathogens (45 to 48%). Cows diagnosed with metritis and flagged based on HIS had substantial alterations of their rumination, activity, and HIS patterns around CD, suggesting that the AHMS was effective for identifying cows with severe cases of metritis, but less effective for identifying cows with mild cases of metritis. The overall accuracy of the AHMS alerts combining rumination and activity indicated that it could be a useful tool for identifying cows with metabolic and digestive disorders, and more severe cases of mastitis and metritis.
Experiments presented in Section II demonstrated that extending duration of VWP from 60 to 88 days increased pregnancies per artificial insemination to first service, but delayed time to pregnancy during lactation and increased the risk of leaving the herd, particularly for multiparous cows. This shift in pregnancy timing led to an extension of the lactation length, which resulted in greater total milk yield per lactation. Extending the duration of the VWP may increase profitability of primiparous cows and reduce profitability of multiparous cows, primarily due to differences in herd replacement dynamics and milk production efficiency. Therefore, farms may benefit from extending the duration of the VWP beyond 60 d for primiparous cows but not for multiparous cows. Finally, we also observed that reproductive management strategies that led to similar average days to the first service (~60 d) through a combination of inseminations at estrus with timed-artificial insemination (TAI) or all TAI resulted in reduced time to pregnancy after calving when compared with an all TAI program with a longer VWP."

Through a wide selection of ethnographic vignettes, it analyzes such boundary work around caste from multiple vantage points to illustrate how this category of identification is reproduced in tension with and in the service of neoliberal processes that have shaped Sri Lanka‚Äôs ‚Äútraditional craft industries‚Äù since the 1977 implementation of an ‚Äúopen economy policy.‚Äù Grounded in two years of ethnographic fieldwork in the country‚Äôs central province, the dissertation offers anthropological insight into what happens at the level of everyday experience when the logics of neoliberal economics and democratic egalitarianism become entangled with nationalist investments in heritage on the one hand, and the apparent specters of pre-modern preoccupations with hierarchy and honor on the other. In this majority Buddhist island country, caste among the Sinhalese has long been popularly rejected as an anachronistic and lamentable artifact of pre-colonial society, its public discussion generally avoided to an extreme. Focusing on two industries regarded as exemplary of Sri Lanka‚Äôs traditional handicrafts, Dumbara rata weaving and the hana industry, I document the complex ways in which some of the country‚Äôs most historically marginalized peoples, individuals at the lowest rungs of what is often figured as a Sinhala caste hierarchy, face the consequences of caste‚Äôs quiet but indisputable reproduction in their daily lives. Challenging a persistent sense in scholarship on the country that caste is somehow destined to disappear, the dissertation‚Äôs primary aim is to demonstrate not just that caste as a category of identification is alive and well, but also how this is so. As significantly, it is to illustrate beyond any doubt that its reproduction is the shared responsibility of actors across the strata of class, gender, age and caste.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:34Z (GMT).

Two main areas of application are intramammary (IMM) treatment of clinical mastitis (CM) and dry-cow therapy, which account for 80% of antibiotic use on dairies.  The objectives herein were to 1) evaluate if the antibiotic hetacillin fell within a margin of efficacy or ‚Äúnoninferiority‚Äù to the reference treatment, a critically important (to human medicine) third-generation cephalosporin, ceftiofur; 2) assess a protocol that selectively treats CM cases based on daily culture results; 3) determine if similar protocols can be effectively executed on moderate-sized dairies without daily access to a professional laboratory; 4) determine if the metagenomic profiles of CM cases highlight a missed opportunity for non-treated cases; and 5) evaluate a culture-independent selective dry-cow therapy (SDCT) protocol. Noninferiority of hetacillin was concluded for bacteriological and clinical cures, as well as for many secondary outcomes. Administration of hetacillin over ceftiofur decreased treatment pen time with no statistical differences in bacteriological, pathogen, or clinical cures; milk yield and linear score (LS) postevent; nor additional risk of culling or quarter-level mastitis after the event.  Use of a selective pathogen-based protocol decreased milk withholding time with no statistical differences in days to clinical cure, milk yield, and LS postevent; nor additional odds of culling in the months following.  When similar strategies were applied on 8 moderate-sized dairies using on-farm or 5 day/week diagnostics, irregularity of data recording was drastically improved and no negative changes were reported. Reductions in antimicrobial use ranged from 6.8% to 92.5% and economic savings amounted to $2,200 to $4,600/dairy/yr. 16S rRNA analysis validated that despite dysbacteriosis in the mammary gland, there was no pathogen profile that was associated with negative or positive health and production outcomes; missed opportunities were not apparent. Finally, application of a data-driven, SDCT protocol resulted in no statistical differences in new infection risk, milk production and LS, or additional odds of culling or mastitis over the periparturient period between selectively or blanket-treated  low-risk cows. Using SDCT or pathogen-based protocols for the treatment and prevention of CM can reduce antibiotic use by up to 2/3.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:38Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

BREASTFEEDING EXPERIENCES OF LOW INCOME WOMEN IN THREE SETTINGS
Joan Doyle Paddock
Cornell University, 2017
	The fact that the majority (53%) of infants in the US are born to women living at 185% of poverty or less who participate in the WIC program raises the stakes on any discussion of maternal and infant care for low income women. The importance of breastfeeding for infant development and the prevention of chronic diseases in later life underscores the significance of this opportunity to positively influence the health and wellbeing of a large and growing portion of the US population. However, in the US, low income and minority women are less likely to breastfeed. The papers in this dissertation examine aspects of breastfeeding support that are available for low income women in three different program settings: an urban, Baby Friendly Hospital, a nutrition education program, and a worksite where breastfeeding support policies had just been introduced. 
	In each setting, the changes made to support breastfeeding had a positive impact. For women delivering at a Baby Friendly Hospital, the supportive policies of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) resulted in breastfeeding discharge rate of 73%. Based on interviews, many women would not have initiated breastfeeding, or would have given up before discharge without the assistance of hospital based lactation consultants as required by the BFHI.  WIC peer counselors were the only community breastfeeding support reported. A broader system of community supports would be a benefit to low income women delivering in this setting. For women participating in the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP), peer support provided by EFNEP educators at home visits had an impact on breastfeeding duration. Women receiving home visits, on average, doubled the breastfeeding duration goals they had set at enrollment. Lastly, the implementation of employee policies in support of breastfeeding resulted in an increase in the overall breastfeeding rates from pre to post implementation (+9.35%), and an increase in breastfeeding after employees returned to work (+2%). Job position (academic vs hourly) remained a critical factor for women breastfeeding after return to work. Job position and associated privileges such as a private office or autonomy over one‚Äôs schedule are not easily mitigated. 
	Given the overwhelming benefits of breastfeeding in providing optimal nutrition for infants, the changes in each program have the potential to contribute to long term health of the infants they serve."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:36Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The entry of influenza virus is mediated by two proteins: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). During virus infection, HA first binds to sialic acid moieties on epithelial cell membranes, triggering engulfment of the virus into the cell via endocytosis. As the endosome matures during trafficking, the pH decreases in the micro-environment, which triggers the conformational change of HA that induces membrane fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes. Fusion allows the virus to release viral RNA into the cytosol of the cell. Single particle tracking (SPT) enables the study of viral binding and membrane fusion at the single-virion level to obtain high resolution measurements of each of these processes in vitro. SPT combines total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy with microfluidics and supported lipid bilayers, making it a very powerful tool for host-pathogen membrane fusion studies. One concern about influenza is that the virus can mutate quickly via three mechanisms (i.e. error-prone RNA replication, influenza reassortment, and influenza recombination). Influenza virus mutation mechanisms may cause the emergence of new strains, some of which may lead to serious flu pandemics in humans. Understanding the fusion fitness of influenza strains at the single-virion level is crucial for the development of anti-viral fusion drugs which block genome transfer. However, high risk live influenza pandemic strains can be infectious and lethal to humans, which makes them a challenge to study in the laboratory environment without significant safety protocols in place. To study the influenza pandemic virus, using a pseudovirus is the most common surrogate system for studying virus entry. However, before this work, no studies directly compared the entry processes of pseudoviruses with their wildtype particles. Here I use SPT to compare the fusion kinetics of influenza native virus and its pseudovirus analog and show that these particles do recapitulate the native behavior well. I will then show how I use pseudoviruses to mimic influenza reassortment and shed light on how influenza reassortment can infect virus entry. Next, I report results on SPT studies of virus entry of influenza virus H10N8 (JX346), a virus of concern because, although there have been only 3 confirmed cases, it was transmitted directly from chicken to human in 2014, with high lethality. Lastly, I will expand the SPT technique to study the inhibitory mechanism of an influenza antiviral drug, IFITM3. IFITM3 has been shown to be able to stop influenza virus entry at the fusion step, and lead to the failure of infection.		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:39Z (GMT).

MAP infections have detrimental consequences for animal health and reduce dairy-herd productivity. Bacterial fastidiousness and slow generation time encumber diagnostic testing strategies. MAP is also a potential etiologic agent of human Crohn‚Äôs disease, with the bulk-milk supply serving as a possible transmission vector. The objective of this dissertation is to explore MAP infection dynamics on dairy farms, with an emphasis on the routes of bulk-milk contamination, transmission risk across production type, and the interplay between diagnostic testing outcomes. Accordingly, we have applied statistical and mathematical approaches to both cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets. 
Using questionnaire data from 292 U.S. dairies, we conducted a comparative risk assessment of organic vs. conventional management and determined that organic herds were at higher risk for new MAP infections. We concluded, empirically, that organic farms were more susceptible to a synergism of risk factors within the maternity pen and should improve calving-area hygiene if electing to permit cow-calf contact. Bulk-milk testing was also conducted for these herds. Most high ELISA tanks were PCR negative, implying that ELISA is not a perfect predictor of bulk-milk MAP status; for accurate risk assessment, bulk-milk ELISA should be used in tandem with PCR. A combination of ELISA and PCR may also aid in determining the specific route of bulk-milk contamination (either environmental or direct shedding). 
To extend the investigation to individual animals, longitudinal data were obtained from 14 MAP-positive cows in 2 low-prevalence herds. Robust relationships between culture, fecal qPCR, and milk ELISA were revealed, using mixed linear modeling to adjust for cow characteristics. We explored temporal relationships and observed that spikes in fecal shedding were predictive of subsequent high milk ELISA results. We also noted that disease ‚ÄúProgressors,‚Äù (infected animals with increasing fecal MAP CFU over time) had higher antibody titers overall. Interestingly, the paucity of positive milk samples, from both individual and bulk- tank sources, suggests that milk contamination is not a chief concern in low-prevalence herds. 
Armed with insights from these studies, in addition to published literature, we developed a mathematical model to explore the interaction between categories of infection, environmental MAP burden, and bulk-tank contamination. Direct shedding into milk accounted for < 1% of the MAP CFU in the tank, with environmental contamination from high shedders as the primary driver of bulk-milk MAP burden. Culling of high shedders, cleaning of the maternity pen, and adherence to milking parlor cleanliness each had a strong influence on lowering the bulk-milk MAP load. A combination of these initiatives served to drive the MAP level below an acceptable threshold (< 103 CFU/L). While complete elimination of MAP may be an unrealistic target for high-prevalence herds, the production of bulk milk with a low MAP load appears feasible. 
In this work, we assess the significance of a variety of contamination routes, transmission risks, and intervention strategies. These efforts are directed toward improved understanding of testing schemes and an ultimate refinement of control measures and milk quality programs. The conclusions from the studies presented in this dissertation may be applied to mitigate the spread of MAP in dairy herds, reduce prevalence, and lower or eliminate MAP in the bulk-milk supply."

Lynch, Michael E.||Pinch, Trevor J.	2018-10-02T20:15:36Z			12/30/17		"This dissertation examines how and why neuroscience has entered the field of social problems research. A subset of neuroscientists I studied is now doing research with the explicit purpose of addressing poverty, adversity, and inequality. Their foundational claim is that experiences in the world and interactions with other people ‚Äì an ‚Äúenvironment of relationships‚Äù ‚Äì are integral in shaping brain development. I investigate how neuroscientists and policymakers produce scientific knowledge about the developing brain, and put forward a new sociotechnical vision for governance. Those involved in this project understand themselves as using science to advocate for a more just society that takes responsibility for the health and well being of its most vulnerable and disadvantaged citizens. Despite these good intentions, my neuroscientist interviewees found themselves at the center of controversy during their early careers. Critics from within the scientific community were worried that the research was based upon eugenicist and racist assumptions. The neuroscience community eventually accepted the work, and the controversy subsided. More recently, however, the studies have gotten wider coverage, and a similar strand of criticism, albeit from outside of the scientific community, has resurfaced.  
Through ethnographic methods, I studied the knowledge production and policymaking practices of this group, as well as the controversy that ensued and how my participants react to it. I pay close attention to the science-policy relationship, and show that building neuroscience-based policy requires extensive negotiation amongst actors, where they must contend with both social and scientific concerns. The production of a new narrative called the ‚ÄúBrain Story‚Äù exemplifies this process. I found that neuroscience brings new attention to age-old problems, and positions itself as a powerful new voice in the arena of early childhood development by pulling together discourses of science, economics, and our moral responsibility to children.  
I argue that the research is at once a reflection and repudiation of biomedical modes of analysis. Though this approach values biomedical evidence about the individual, scientists I interviewed believe that the best way to solve social problems is by intervening at the level of the social. Though well-intentioned, the research may produce unintended consequences."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:36Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Poor and vulnerable households are unable to smooth their food consumption in times of drought, flood or when pests destroy their crops. This dissertation draws on the poverty literature and posits resilience as a latent capacity allowing households to recover from the effects of shocks. It presents several definitions and measurements across multiple contexts. In particular, this thesis explores the tension between focusing on a shock-specific response and emphasizing household well-being in a stochastic context. It analyzes both short and long term measurements of food security in Malawi and Ethiopia, investigating the effects of internal interventions as well as household-level characteristics that may allow households to better manage risk. The first chapter motivates the investigation in the context of eliminating hunger and expanding our understanding of socio-ecological systems. The second chapter investigates the causal impact of the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) in Ethiopia, finding that it mitigates the effect of drought on long-term food insecurity. The third chapter uses a novel 12 month high frequency dataset in Malawi to track the incidence and persistence of subjective shocks. It finds that households living in the flood plain and those with fields far from home are more resilient to the effects of drought, while female-headed households are less resilient to the effects of illness. It also illustrates the use of machine learning algorithms to identify predictors of short-term food insecurity. The fourth and final chapter picks up on the insight that households with spatially dispersed parcels may better manage risk. Using a natural experiment from Ethiopia, it shows that land fragmentation reduces both short and long-term food insecurity. Endowed with a diversified set of parcel characteristics, households grow a more varied set of crops, mitigating the effect of drought. Together, these chapters argue that reducing food insecurity and improving resilience is possible. In order to avoid doing more harm than good, external interventions must take into account households' and communities' existing ability to mitigate shocks.

colliders and hidden sectors. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is just starting
to reach its maximum operational capabilities. However, already with the current
data, large classes of models are being put under significant pressure. It is crucial
to understand whether the (thus far) null results are a consequence of a lack of
solution to the hierarchy problem around the weak scale or requires expanding
the search strategy employed at the LHC. It is the duty of the current generation
of physicists to design new searches to ensure that no stone is left unturned. To
this end, we study the sensitivity of the LHC to the couplings in the Standard
Model top sector. We find it can significantly improve the measurements on Zt R t R
coupling by a novel search strategy, making use of an implied unitarity violation
in such models. Analogously, we show that other couplings in the top sector can
also be measured with the same technique. Furthermore, we critically analyze a
set of anomalies in the LHC data and how they may appear from consistent UV
completions. We also propose a technique to measure lifetimes of new colored
particles with non-trivial spin.
While the high energy frontier will continue to take data, it is likely the only
collider of its kind for the next couple decades. On the other hand, low-energy
experiments have a promising future with many new proposed experiments to
probe the existence of particles well below the weak scale but with small couplings
to the Standard Model. In this work we survey the different possibilities, focusingon the constraints as well as possible new hidden sector dynamics. In particular,
we show that vector portals which couple to an anomalous current, e.g., baryon
number, are significantly constrained from flavor changing meson decays and rare Z
decays. Furthermore, we present a new mechanism for dark matter freezeout which
depletes the dark sector through an out-of-equilibrium decay into the Standard
Model."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:37Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

I examine how this site is variously enacted as a place of Wabanaki survivance and erasure and ask, how is it that a particular place with a particular history can be mobilized in different and even contradictory ways? I apply Annemarie Mol‚Äôs (2002) analytic concept of the body multiple to place to examine how utilize practices of storytelling, remembering, gathering, producing knowledge, and negotiating relationships to variously enact Norridgewock as a place multiple. I consider the multiple, overlapping, coexistent, and contradictory enactments of place and engagements with knowledge that shape place-worlds in settler colonial nation-states. Rather than taking these different enactments of place to be different perspectives on or versions of place, I examine how these enactments are embedded in and shaped by hierarchies of power and politics that produce enactments of place that are at times parallel and at times contradictory. Place-making is especially political in the context of settler colonialism, where indigenous places, histories, and peoples are erased in order to be replaced (Wolfe 2006; O‚ÄôBrien 2010). I consider how the social hierarches set up through settler colonialism make some enactments of place appear to be more important than others, or even appear as if they are the only enactments at all, rendering other ways of experiencing, knowing, and being in this place irrelevant or invisible. Using a decolonial approach, I unsettle the enactments of this place that produce and reproduce Wabanaki erasure narratives and show how, through stories, memories, and practices of gathering, Wabanaki peoples enact Norridgewock as simultaneously a site of violence and a site of their survivance and hope for the future.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:38Z (GMT).

Two approaches are especially powerful at linking these processes to patterns: mathematical modeling and using a citizen science dataset. This dissertation uses these two approaches to detect unobservable biological processes from observable patterns in three separate studies: monarch butterfly population dynamics in eastern United States, microbiota population dynamics in fly gut, and mating strategy dynamics in hybridizing species pairs. First, the dissertation tests whether a continental population decline of the monarch butterfly is caused by the scarcity of milkweed, as the milkweed decline has been shown to locally impact monarch population. The study concludes that the milkweed scarcity is not the cause of the continental monarch decline. An observation made at a microscopic scale cannot be extrapolated to explain the pattern at a macroscopic scale. Second, the dissertation develops novel method to understand population dynamics of ingested bacteria from fecal time-series taken from its host. Application of this method to experiments using Drosophila shows that bacterial population is regulated over larger gut area in the host as the density of bacteria increases. Information on processes at a microscopic scale may be preserved at a macroscopic scale. Third, the dissertation develops a model to understand how unequal population sizes between hybridizing species pairs influence the evolution of mate choosiness in these species. An observation of greater choosiness in a smaller population has often been interpreted as evidence for reinforcement, but our results suggest that this interpretation is not valid. Some microscopic processes may dominate others to generate macroscopic patterns. Lastly, this dissertation highlights the importance of scale not only in basic science, but also in applications such as conservation and medicine.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:37Z (GMT).

The first three chapters are readings of speeches and scenes
informed by a focus on each character‚Äôs rhetorical goals and persuasive strategies. I concentrate particularly on passages in which characters invent, distort, and speak tendentiously in other ways. The final two chapters argue that the Vergilian narrator is misdirecting, because he uses untrue character speech to raise unfulfilled expectations, and that he is suppressive, because he leaves out much, and displaces the telling of much onto unreliable characters‚Äô claims. 
In the first chapter I examine how the reader perceives what characters in the Aeneid know, how the characters come to know, and how they use what they know. In the second chapter I interpret the diplomatic exchanges between Ilioneus and Latinus and between Aeneas
and Evander as rhetorical contests for advantage, informed by the chaotic military and political world that is Vergil‚Äôs Italy. In the third chapter I argue that the speech in the last four books shifts to disputing the responsibility for the outbreak of the war and the question of over what the war is being fought. In the fourth chapter I argue that the rhetorical strategies used by characters in the Aeneid to manipulate and persuade other characters are closely intertwined with the narrative strategies used by Vergil to misdirect the expectations of his readers. In the fifth chapter I suggest some broader effects on our understanding of the Aeneid that may follow from my readings of character speech and narrative technique in the first four chapters."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:52Z (GMT).

Our overall goal was to assess key human host factors, including vitamin D and the gut microbiome, which affect this dual burden and have bi-directional effects on inflammation. Specifically, our objectives were to: 
1) assess the predictive performance of common anthropometric cut-offs utilized in diabetes population screening; 
2) examine the association between vitamin D and metabolic indicators; 
3) assess gut microbiota differences based on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) status; 
among a population with a high prevalence of suspected or confirmed active TB disease and low or normal body mass index (BMI).
Methods: At a rural hospital in South India, adult outpatients were enrolled after providing informed consent. Data collection included interviews, clinical examinations, anthropometry, and biological samples. Three study participant subsets were included in different analyses. Cornell University and the hospital institutional review boards approved study protocols.
Results: Most study participants had BMI <25 kg/m2 (88.2%) or waist circumference (WC) < diabetes screening cut-offs among South Asian populations (79.3%), which would be considered low risk in diabetes screening. However, one-third of study participants either had glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ‚â• 6.5% (12.3%) or between 5.7% and <6.5% (20.3%). BMI ‚â•25.0 kg/m2 demonstrated low sensitivity (0.21; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.35) as a screening indicator for HbA1c ‚â• 6.5%. Median 25(OH)D was 51.8 nmol/L (IQR 36.0-70.0). Serum 25(OH)D was inversely associated with glycated hemoglobin and WC (both p<0.05), respectively, though not hypertension or gut microbiota diversity (all p>0.05). Most bacterial sequences in rectal swab samples were from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla.
Conclusions: Our findings indicate a high prevalence of elevated HbA1c (‚â• 5.7%), and suggest the need for population-specific BMI and WC cut-offs in diabetes screening. Vitamin D status was associated with HbA1c, however not gut microbiome diversity. Further studies are needed to elucidate the potential roles of vitamin D and the gut microbiome in mitigating the dual burden of metabolic abnormalities and active TB disease among populations with low BMI in resource-limited settings."		12/18/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:53Z (GMT).

The wireless spectrum, already a scarce resource, is ever-dwindling and becoming more expensive: an FCC auction in 2015 gathered $41B for 1,611 licenses around the 1700MHz band. Projections indicate an even further increase in wireless data usage: Cisco predicts a 7-fold increase in mobile data usage from 2016 to 2021. One emerging trend to mitigate the spectrum overuse is to explore whitespace, locally unused frequency bands that were previously reserved for TV and maritime communications. However, the current circuit solutions to alleviate spectrum crunch such as duplexers and circulators inherently frequency-selective, and therefore not tunable. Also, most current wireless systems use TDD (time-division duplexing), which is not the most efficient way to use the spectrum. Frequency-division duplexing is more spectrally efficient, but in a non-MIMO system the transmitter is usually at a high enough power level to saturate or sometimes even destroy the receiver. These problems are exacerbated in full duplex systems. In this thesis, we present a comprehensive solution to the spectrum scarcity problem by attacking on two fronts: instead of a narrow-band, fixed frequency solution we propose a software defined radio that has a wide range of tunability. Furthermore, we take advantage of duplexing in frequency with only a single antenna to more efficiently use the spectrum available. We also analyze the theoretical bounds of our transceiver to inform system parameters. Furthermore, we propose a novel schematic level model to accurately simulate harmonic distortion products in switching circuits. We use this model to better predict linearity numbers in passive mixers in deep triode.		12/4/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:41Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This work addresses some issues for implementing GS in cassava. First, we evaluated multivariate and univariate GS models via prediction accuracies. Second, the genetic basis for DM content was investigated using the Regional Heritability Mapping (RHM) procedure. Lastly, the genetic basis for co-inheritance of DM, root color and fresh yield (FYLD) were investigated using the Regional co-heritability Mapping (RHM) procedure. Key lessons were: (1) Multitrait (MT) models for single location data offered 40% higher average prediction accuracies for genomic breeding values (GEBVs) of six target traits across 3 locations compared to single-trait (uT) models. (2) Multivariate multi-environment (ME) models also offered 12% higher average prediction accuracies compared to a compound symmetric multi-environment model (uE) parameterized as a univariate multi-kernel model for multi-year multi-environment data. (3) The RHM analysis identified segments associated with DM in white cassava on chromosomes 1, 4, 5, 10, 17,18 and on yellow cassava chromosome 1. Candidates extracted from genes adjacent to the RHM significant segments include: glycosyltransferases, serine-threonine kinases (SnRKs), invertases and fructose bisphosphate aldolase. Prediction accuracies from these candidates and all genes in the RHM significant regions suggest that they may be tagging regions associated with DM. (4) Genome-wide segment correlations from the RcHM analysis in yellow cassava showed a limited prospect for high DM yellow cassava development but good prospects for high DM, high yielding white cassava development.

In addition to standard corporate governance measures like setting up boards of directors and convening shareholders meetings, many business-owning families have also begun applying rule-based structures and procedures to regulate relationships between family members. Following the recommendations of consultants belonging to a newly emerging field of family business expertise, these Colombian business-owning families write out what they refer to as ‚Äúfamily protocols,‚Äù and gather in ‚Äúfamily assemblies,‚Äù where they work specifically toward the continuity of their family businesses. 
Based on twenty months of ethnographic field research among members of such families in Bogot√°, Colombia, this dissertation explores how family business governance and the idea of successful succession create bonds of kinship among family shareholders. Specifically, I argue that the procedures of governance and the notions of efficacy that consultant recommendations involve, provide family members with a means to enact family identities that are closely associated with obligations to work. For individuals who are descendants of notable entrepreneurs and understand themselves as having inherited their unique disposition for success, expert-endorsed measures present tangible ways to take family relationships into their own hands. As such, I argue that in this context, kinship is re-created alongside family governance, and not necessarily as a result of it. In other words, it is the idea that family business can be sustained through concerted action, combined with ideologies of genealogy and of expertise, that continue to bring together shareholders to interact as family. 
Drawing from anthropological accounts that disrupt notions of expertise based on efficacy, this study of the role of expert knowledge in the production of kinship among Colombian business-owning families contributes to the ongoing effort in anthropology to elucidate the contingent constitution of relatedness. In this case, a close engagement with how family business successful succession motivates specific forms of agency presents kinship as an unexpected effect of business expertise. In addition, by presenting the enactment of family as an unintended consequence of the ideas and techniques of consultants rather than as their direct result, the dissertation provides a framework in which to consider a fuller picture of concerted action in the world of business."

Chemical cues produced by different organisms are products of primary and secondary metabolism, and are highly specific in their structural assembly and signaling functions. Minute differences in structures and functions of these metabolites can, for example, help an organism distinguish between pathogenic and beneficial microbes, cause the organism to extend or reduce its lifespan, signal availability or lack of sustenance, and provide snapshots of its metabolic state. As such, it is crucial to annotate structures and functions of the underlying chemical causes behind biological effects, understand how subtle structural differences cause dramatic changes in observed phenotypes, and elucidate their biosynthetic mechanisms to learn how biological information is encoded in these signaling molecules.   	Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) is rapidly becoming an indispensable tool in the study of signaling molecules using comparative metabolomics. This technique far outdoes classical activity-guided fractionation methods to identify chemical cues in biological systems in terms of required time, ease of use and sensitivity. The use of both activity-guided fractionation and UHPLC-MS/MS techniques to elucidate structures of signaling molecules involved in host-pathogen interactions between nematodes and bacteria, and mitochondrion-mediated longevity in nematode are discussed in this dissertation. Forward genetic approaches to identify biosynthetic enzymes responsible for the highly specific assembly of nematode-derived modular metabolites, and validation of their biosynthetic functions are also described. Finally, an untargeted metabolomics approach combining high resolution UHPLC-MS/MS data with genome-wide association studies to annotate the nematode metabolome and identify candidate biosynthetic genes for various metabolites is evaluated."		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:41Z (GMT).

The modeling of transport and rheology in such confined inhomogeneous soft materials requires an accurate description of the microscopic forces driving particle motion, such as entropic and hydrodynamic forces, and of particle interactions with nearby boundaries. Previous models of such micro-confined transport behavior had been limited primarily to a single particle inside a spherical cavity. Although attempts had been made prior to this work to extend such models to more than one confined particle, none had yet successfully accounted for the effects of hydrodynamics, owing to the difficulties of modeling many-body long-ranged interactions. To accurately model spherically confined suspensions, new far-field mobility functions are derived and, together with the appropriate near-field resistance functions, implemented in a Stokesian-dynamics like approach.  The method fully accounts for all many-body far-field interactions and near-field interactions both between the particles themselves and between particles and the enclosing cavity. Utilizing the newly developed method, we study short- and long- time self-diffusion at equilibrium, with a focus on the dependence of the former on particle positions relative to the cavity, and of both on volume fraction and size ratio.  It is found that the cavity exerts qualitative changes in transport behavior, such as a position dependent and anisotropic short-time self-diffusivity and anisotropic long-time transport behavior.  Such qualitative changes suggest that careful interpretation of experimental measurements in 3D confined suspensions requires accounting for such confinement induced behaviors.  To elucidate the effects of confinement on inter-particle hydrodynamic interactions, the method is utilized to determine the concentrated mobility of particles in the spherically confined domain. Confinement is found to induce qualitative changes in the functional dependence of particle entrainment with inter-particle separation. For widely separated particles, the functional dependence on inter-particle separation can be predicted via a Green's function.  How this behavior can be utilized to develop a more accurate framework for two-point microrheology measurements near confining boundaries is discussed.

cell phones to ultra-large television panels. Amorphous silicon (a-
Si) has been the industry workhorse as the active semiconductor in pixeladdressing
transistors due to its uniformity and low production costs. However,
a-Si can no longer support larger and higher-resolution displays, and new materials
with higher electron mobilities are required. Amorphous indium gallium
zinc oxide (a-IGZO), which retains the uniformity and low cost of amorphous
films, has emerged as a viable candidate due to its enhanced transport properties.
However, a-IGZO devices suffer from long-term instabilities‚Äîthe origins
of which are not yet fully understood‚Äîcausing a drift in switching characteristics
over time and affecting product lifetime. More recently, devices fabricated
from textured nanocrystalline IGZO, termed c-axis aligned crystalline (CAAC),
have demonstrated superior stability. Unfortunately, little is known regarding
the phase formation and crystallization kinetics of either the CAAC structure or
in the broader ternary IGZO system.
Crystallinity and texture of CAAC IGZO films deposited by RF reactive
sputtering were studied and characterized over a wide range of deposition conditions.
The characteristic CAAC (0 0 9) peak at 2 = 30 was observed by X-ray
diffraction, and nanocrystalline domain texture was determined using a general
area detector diffraction system (GADDS). Highly ordered CAAC films were
obtained near the InGaZnO4 composition at a substrate temperature of 310C
and in a 10%O2/90% Ar sputtering ambient. High-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) confirmed the formation of CAAC and identified 2‚Äì
3 nm domains coherently aligned over large ranges extending beyond the field
of view (15 nm  15 nm). Cross-section HRTEM of the CAAC/substrate interface
shows formation of an initially disordered IGZO layer prior to CAAC
formation, suggesting a nucleation mechanism similar to ZnO thin films. A
classical nucleation and growth model is proposed and compared to alternative
models proposed in literature.
Extending this study of CAAC IGZO, the formation and growth of crystalline
IGZO over a wide composition range and processing conditions were
explored. IGZO itself is one composition of a class of homologous structures
in the pseudo-binary InGaO3(ZnO)m system. For integer m, the equilibrium
structure is known and well-characterized; however, for non-integer m, disorder
must exist and the kinetics of the structural development remain almost
completely unknown. A high-throughput (combinatorial) approach utilizing
co-sputter deposition, millisecond timescale thermal gradient laser annealing,
and spatially-resolved characterization using microbeam wide-angle X-ray scattering
was used to probe the structural evolution as a function of temperature,
time, and composition. As-deposited films were amorphous in the InGaO3-
rich composition range, becoming crystalline (wurtzite) with increasing ZnO
content. Under millisecond heating, films evolved toward the equilibrium layered
structure consisting of nearly pure In2O3 layers with (Ga, Zn)Ox interlayers.
Composition deviations (non-integer m) are discussed within a model of
cationic disorder in both the In2O3 layers and the (Ga, Zn)Ox layers. Crystal-tocrystal
transformations in the high-ZnO region are discussed within the context
of a new growth model for these homologous structures. This deeper understanding
of the nature of crystalline IGZO will help to enable the successful
implementation of CAAC IGZO for high-performance display applications."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:58Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Resting rat basophilic leukemia cells were used under a variety of pharmacological perturbations. Yellow Fluorescent Protein-Glycan-Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (YFP-gl-GPI) was used as the outer-leaflet Lo-like region marker, palmitoyl and myristoyl-Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (PM-EGFP) was used as the inner-leaflet Lo-like region marker, and geranylgeranylated EGFP (EGFP-GG) was used as an Ld-like lipid region marker on the inner leaflet. Treatments included C2- & C6-ceramide, cholesterol depletion by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, 7-ketocholesterol addition, and cytochalasin D.  These membrane perturbing treatments were done in efforts to identify a condition in which Lo-like regions would be disrupted for further study regarding IgE high affinity receptor signaling. C6-ceramide treatments showed a propensity to disorder Lo-like regions symmetrically for both leaflets of Lo-like domain markers, but only resulted in a ~10% decrease in œÑ0 for Alexa488-IgE-FcŒµRI without significant change in D. Aside from short-chain ceramide treatment, all other treatments resulted in either no change, or some degree of increase in œÑ0 for these fluorescent reporters, indicating the local lipid environment as not having changed or increased respectively. Asymmetric effects under treatment conditions between lipid monolayer Lo-like preferring markers were also observed.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:42Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

It promises, at least on paper, greater efficiency and higher accelerating gradients, with the potential to enable the construction of smaller yet more powerful accelerators than can be constructed using niobium. Although the state-of-the-art performance of cavities coated with Nb3Sn has shown great potential, the achievable limits in cavity quality factor Q0 and accelerating gradient Eacc are still below that expected given theoretical limits. In this work we present and discuss results of experiments carried out to understand the current limitations on Q0 and Eacc, and propose methods to improve these further. We will conclude with an outlook to the future, and the prospects that Nb3Sn could enable.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:39Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In this dissertation, I explore what phenotypes to measure when breeding for downy mildew resistance and improved floral scent and how to measure these phenotypes accurately and efficiently. Traditionally, downy mildew resistance has been measured by visually rating sporulation and hypersensitive response on leaves or leaf discs. However, such manual ratings become intractable when dealing with thousands of samples. Therefore, to measure sporulation on leaf discs, I developed a computer vision system that reduced phenotyping time by more than 90% when compared to manual ratings, and also was found to work well for phenotyping leaf trichomes. If phenotypes are collected in the vineyard, spatial variation from inoculum, soil, and microclimate might have an effect on these phenotypes. Testing this assumption, spatial processes explained some variance in vineyard phenotypes, but accounting for the spatial variance might not lead to significantly more accurate phenotypes. Quantitative phenotyping of floral scent for large numbers of grapevines using headspace analysis is not economically feasible, so I evaluated the robustness of a hexane extraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify floral volatiles and found that it was robust regardless of extraction time when flowers were sampled from the same inflorescence. After obtaining phenotypes and genotypes of vines, quantitative trait loci are found, traditionally using one phenotype at a time. In our case, understanding how sporulation, HR, and leaf trichomes affected each other was of interest, in addition to how genetic markers affected the phenotypes, so I used Bayesian networks to explore these interactions. In one of two F1 families studied, HR had a positive effect on sporulation, and leaf trichomes had a negative effect on both HR and sporulation, suggesting that leaf trichome density can be selected for in breeding for downy mildew disease resistance. A breeding project was started with the intention of creating a dwarf grapevine with an attractive floral scent. With a complementary interest to understand what volatile compounds were responsible for the various floral scents in grapevine, a diverse set of genotypes from various Vitis spp. were phenotyped for floral scent and volatiles, and it was found that similar scents were generated from different sesquiterpene profiles. Overall, this dissertation spans key concepts in the science of plant breeding, from parental selection and hybridization, to phenotyping by computer vision and chemical analysis, to statistical analyses of interacting phenotypes, genotypes, and spatial variability, with the findings possibly enhancing grapevine breeding strategies and execution.		12/18/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:40Z (GMT).

The underlying sensory pathway responsible for this movement involves transmembrane receptors called methyl accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) that couple with the intracellular histidine kinase CheA and adaptor protein CheW. Bacterial chemotaxis has long served as a model system for understanding the mechanisms of signal transduction. However, the exact mechanisms for the remarkable sensitivity and signal amplification of this system remains to be fully understood.  In this dissertation, I present structural and activities studies of various proteins involved in bacterial chemotaxis. In particular, I focus on elucidating the structural changes that occur in the dimeric histidine kinase CheA when it switches between the kinase-on and kinase-off activity states. In this work I have utilized a newly developed in vitro chemotaxis system that consists of soluble receptor mimetics that couple to CheA and CheW to form ternary complexes suitable for single-particle experiments. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and mass spectrometry experiments demonstrate that the deactivated kinase forms a more compact and rigid structure. Additionally, crystallography and cross-linking experiments demonstrate that domains in the dimer self-associate when CheA is deactivated. In addition, I have determined the role of a previously uncharacterized protein whose gene is often found next to those for cytoplasmic receptors. We have named this new chemotaxis protein ODP1 for Oxygen Di-iron Protein and I have extensively characterized homologs of ODP1 from Treponema denticola and Thermotoga maritima using structural and biochemical methods. Analytical and spectrometric techniques demonstrate that iron and oxygen are ligands of ODP1. Furthermore, in vivo assays with T. denticola confirm that ODP1 acts as an iron and oxygen sensor for the chemotaxis system. Crystal structures of both Td and Tm ODP1 suggests a mechanism for iron sensing.  Finally, I have developed a new method for spin-labeling proteins for EPR experiments. Specifically, I have synthesized and isolated an analog of ADP (ADP-Œ≤-S-SL) that is covalently attached to a nitroxide spin label and can hence be reconstituted into ATP-binding proteins, such as CheA. Indeed, Double Electron Electron Resonance spectroscopy experiments on the CheA kinase confirm that ADP-Œ≤-S-SL is an appropriate method for determining distance distributions from non-covalently bound spin probes.  In summary, my work has provided new insights into the domain rearrangements that occur in CheA due to receptor mediated modulation. Additionally, I‚Äôve characterized a new chemotaxis sensor protein that is responsible for monitoring intracellular levels of iron and oxygen.

The introduction of the various particles, especially nanoparticles, results in significantly altered microstructure (grain size and morphology). The target metal particles or mixtures of particles are aerosolized first and carried into the molten metal for alloying.  Cast iron and 1018 steel are chosen as the raw materials while metal powders (Ti, W, Nb) with different size scale (micron and nano-scale) are alloyed into the molten metals through different approaches (regular alloying and aerosol technology). Compared to the alloys produced by conventional metallurgy (regular alloying and regular size particles), the new alloys exhibit significantly altered microstructures and refinement of grain size, and much better uniform distribution as observed with EDS element mapping. The experiments confirm that the nanoparticle-aerosol technology is a promising approach with good versatility and can realize excellent dispersion of alloyed agents even with trace amount of injection. Moreover, this approach is shown to be more advantageous over conventional metallurgy and seems to have potential in industrial applications.

My dissertation aims to empirically evaluate the cost-effectiveness of certain programs that intend to increase the fleet fuel economy including consumer subsidies for adopting alternative fuel vehicles (AVFs) and the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards imposed on manufacturers. The dissertation is comprised of three chapters. Chapter 1 studies the impact of income tax credit for electric vehicle (EV) purchases and compare its cost-effectiveness with an alternative policy that subsidies charging stations when indirect network effects exist in the market. Chapter 2 estimates consumer vehicle demand using random coefficient discrete choice model and examines the substitution pattern of EVs with other fuel types, which helps assessing the environmental benefits of policies that subsidize EVs. Chapter 3 investigates the differential treatment between light trucks and passenger cars in CAFE standards and estimates to what extent does the standard split undermine the policy goal of increasing the average fleet fuel economy while achieving the redistributional goals.

Current autonomous vehicles that provide motion safety guarantees exhibit excessively conservative driving behavior when operating in road environments containing highly dynamic obstacles. In this thesis we present a contingency-based motion planning framework for autonomous road vehicles. Probabilistic state predictions are generated for each discrete action of nearby obstacle vehicles, and multiple contingency trajectories are planned such that safe execution is possible under each possible discrete action. An online estimation algorithm is used to infer the discrete obstacle action from sensor observations and inform execution-time contingency selection. We present a fast upper bound on a metric of distinguishability that approximates the predicted probability of correctly identifying the discrete action of an obstacle from a set of possible hypotheses. The metric is used to optimize expected execution cost and safety of a set of contingency trajectories. Simulated experiments show that the proposed planning framework produces trajectories with a lower cost and stronger safety guarantees than that of prior work, and this performance improvement persists across a range of vehicle and obstacle initial conditions.
Additionally, a prototype system architecture for a verifiably secure autonomous vehicle is presented. The system architecture is designed to enforce separation of trusted and untrusted information flows. A map verification algorithm is used to verify external data coming from an untrusted source. Motion planning and map verification software components are developed with existing tools that enforce information flow control at the language level. The architecture is implemented on a mobile robotic testbed and experiments are performed to simulate a remote attack scenario. Experimental results show that the architecture is resistant to malicious external data, and can operate safely even when external communications are compromised. Analogies are drawn between the prototype architecture and hardware and software components on real-world autonomous vehicles."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:42:00Z (GMT).

While FEA modeling is mature, there are numerous modeling decisions that influence the reliability and outcomes of the simulation, especially for large material deformation and highly non-linear behaviors such as plasticity and buckling. These decisions become sources of epistemic uncertainty that propagate onto simulation outcomes and thus potentially affect designs. This thesis investigates the impact of two uncertainty sources that are especially relevant in studying buckling -- geometric imperfections and frictional interactions -- on a honeycomb-based cellular material. FEA package Abaqus is selected here and Python scripting is developed to achieve the FEA implementation and design automation. Uncertainty is characterized and quantified based on a large computational experiment, and the impact of the uncertainty on a set of simple robust design optimization and Bayesian optimization problems is illustrated. The results show that, combined, both factors introduce significant variability (up to 20%) in the mechanical response of the material, and consequently lead to changes (up to 10%) of the optimum design in a robust design optimization framework. This study suggests that ignoring these sources of uncertainty may lead to suboptimal designs for this class of material design problems. The methodology and codes developed in this thesis can be used to further explore the mechanical properties of metamaterials and facilitate material design.		12/8/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:44Z (GMT).

Two of these in particular, Titan and Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P), though vastly different in terms of size, thermal history, and composition, offer a diverse array of landscapes for study, and are among the most active bodies in our solar system. Titan, the largest, icy moon of Saturn, has a surface that is covered with organic sediments. These sediments, of unknown origin, are transported by both the wind, and through an Earth-like hydrological cycle across the entire surface. As revealed by Cassini's RADAR instrument, Titan's polar regions maintain a stable inventory of volatile liquids (methane and ethane) that collect into a complex network of lakes and seas. With the completion of the Cassini mission, we show in Chapter 2 the overall geomorphology of these terrains to elucidate the origin and evolution of not only the lakes and seas, but the surrounding landscapes as well. What became immediately clear from this study, was that the majority of Titan's liquids (97%) reside in the north polar region, even though the overall landscapes appear quite similar. We show in Chapter 3 that the presence of large, now-drained sedimentary basins provide additional evidence for a long-term climate cycling of liquids between the poles, akin to the Earth's Croll-Milankovitch cycles. Currently, Titan's orbital configuration favors north polar liquids, where ~10^14 kg^3 of liquid methane is transported northward each Titan year. Evidence of this surface-atmosphere interaction are also recorded in Titan's alluvial fans, sedimentary structures that are predominantly found in Titan's mid-latitudes. This latitude range correlates with the regions of Titan where precipitation discharges are predicted to be highest, the implications of which we discuss in Chapter 4.  67P, though <4-km in size, is another geologically-active world where sublimation erosion drives a complex sedimentary cycle. After entering the inner solar system, where sublimation of water ice is possible, large gradients in thermal insolation promote mass-wasting of the previously consolidated portions of the primitive nucleus. Owing to its low gravity (~0.16 mm/s^2), the products of this failure are ballistically transported to colder, gravitational lows. However, perhaps surprisingly, this is not a uniform process. Instead, the obliquity and eccentricity of 67P's orbit result in a seasonal dependence; northern latitudes, in polar winter at perihelion, are blanketed by sedimentary materials liberated from the warmer southern latitudes. In Chapter 5, we study 67P's global landscapes to understand how this process proceeds, and what it implies for cometary surface geology more generally.

There has been a lively debate in the literature regarding whether valence or arousal is the primary cause of mood-dependent FM.  Because much past research has not effectively disentangled valence from arousal, the present studies used a new mood manipulation that allowed valence and arousal to be controlled and their associated retrieval processes to be measured.  In Experiment 1, low-arousal negative moods reduced false memory compared to positive and neutral moods by increasing verbatim memory traces, confirming the prediction that valence can influence false memory independent of arousal.  In Experiment 2, low-arousal negative moods reduced false memory for both list lengths, but the processes associated with false memory for short lists were not the same as the processes associated with false memory for long lists.  High arousal negative moods in Experiment 3 now increased false memory compared to neutral moods‚Äîbut still reduced false memory compared to positive moods‚Äîwhich suggested that high arousal increased false memory compared to low arousal. .Experiment 4 provided a direct test of arousal‚Äôs effect on false memory and confirmed that higher levels of arousal increase false memory via strong gist traces, regardless of valence.  The results were discussed in support of fuzzy-trace theory‚Äîbut not affect-as-information theory‚Äîand practical applications to the law were noted.

The objectives of the experiments presented in Section II were: evaluating the reproductive performance, herd exit dynamics, lactation performance, and profitability of dairy cows managed with different duration of the voluntary waiting period and methods of submission for first service. 
The studies presented in Section I demonstrated that the sensitivity of the HIS to identify cows with health issues was high for metabolic and digestive disorders (93%) and moderate for cases of clinical mastitis (55%) and metritis (55%). Among mastitis cases, HIS was effective for identifying cows with mastitis caused by Escherichia coli (80.7%), but it was less effective in identifying cows with mastitis caused by other pathogens (45 to 48%). Cows diagnosed with metritis and flagged based on HIS had substantial alterations of their rumination, activity, and HIS patterns around CD, suggesting that the AHMS was effective for identifying cows with severe cases of metritis, but less effective for identifying cows with mild cases of metritis. The overall accuracy of the AHMS alerts combining rumination and activity indicated that it could be a useful tool for identifying cows with metabolic and digestive disorders, and more severe cases of mastitis and metritis.
Experiments presented in Section II demonstrated that extending duration of VWP from 60 to 88 days increased pregnancies per artificial insemination to first service, but delayed time to pregnancy during lactation and increased the risk of leaving the herd, particularly for multiparous cows. This shift in pregnancy timing led to an extension of the lactation length, which resulted in greater total milk yield per lactation. Extending the duration of the VWP may increase profitability of primiparous cows and reduce profitability of multiparous cows, primarily due to differences in herd replacement dynamics and milk production efficiency. Therefore, farms may benefit from extending the duration of the VWP beyond 60 d for primiparous cows but not for multiparous cows. Finally, we also observed that reproductive management strategies that led to similar average days to the first service (~60 d) through a combination of inseminations at estrus with timed-artificial insemination (TAI) or all TAI resulted in reduced time to pregnancy after calving when compared with an all TAI program with a longer VWP."

Through a wide selection of ethnographic vignettes, it analyzes such boundary work around caste from multiple vantage points to illustrate how this category of identification is reproduced in tension with and in the service of neoliberal processes that have shaped Sri Lanka‚Äôs ‚Äútraditional craft industries‚Äù since the 1977 implementation of an ‚Äúopen economy policy.‚Äù Grounded in two years of ethnographic fieldwork in the country‚Äôs central province, the dissertation offers anthropological insight into what happens at the level of everyday experience when the logics of neoliberal economics and democratic egalitarianism become entangled with nationalist investments in heritage on the one hand, and the apparent specters of pre-modern preoccupations with hierarchy and honor on the other. In this majority Buddhist island country, caste among the Sinhalese has long been popularly rejected as an anachronistic and lamentable artifact of pre-colonial society, its public discussion generally avoided to an extreme. Focusing on two industries regarded as exemplary of Sri Lanka‚Äôs traditional handicrafts, Dumbara rata weaving and the hana industry, I document the complex ways in which some of the country‚Äôs most historically marginalized peoples, individuals at the lowest rungs of what is often figured as a Sinhala caste hierarchy, face the consequences of caste‚Äôs quiet but indisputable reproduction in their daily lives. Challenging a persistent sense in scholarship on the country that caste is somehow destined to disappear, the dissertation‚Äôs primary aim is to demonstrate not just that caste as a category of identification is alive and well, but also how this is so. As significantly, it is to illustrate beyond any doubt that its reproduction is the shared responsibility of actors across the strata of class, gender, age and caste.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:41:58Z (GMT).

words like that and so can be used to refer anaphorically to a proposition introduced in a
discourse: That‚Äôs true; She told me so. Much has been written about individual anaphora,
but less attention has been paid to propositional anaphora. This dissertation is a com-
prehensive examination of propositional anaphora, which I argue behaves like anaphora
in other domains, is conditioned by semantic factors, and is not conditioned by purely
syntactic factors nor by the at-issue status of a proposition.
I begin by introducing the concepts of anaphora and propositions, and then I discuss
the various words of English which can have this function: this, that, it, which, so, as, and
the null complement anaphor. I then compare anaphora to propositions with anaphora
in other domains, including individual, temporal, and modal anaphora. I show that the
same features which are characteristic of these other domains are exhibited by proposi-
tional anaphora as well.
I then present data on a wide variety of syntactic constructions‚Äîincluding sub-
clausal, monoclausal, multiclausal, and multisentential constructions‚Äînoting which li-
cense anaphoric reference to propositions. On the basis of this expanded empirical do-
main, I argue that anaphoric reference to a proposition is licensed not by any syntactic
category or movement but rather by the operators which take propositions as arguments.
With this generalization in hand, I turn to how such facts can be formally modeled: I
review existing systems which track anaphora and/or which make use of propositional
variables, and then introduce a new formalism which incorporates insights from these
existing systems.
Finally, I turn to the interaction between a proposition‚Äôs availability for anaphoric ref-
erence and its discourse status (in particular, its at-issue status). Contrary to the prevail-
ing assumption in the literature, I argue that there is no tight linking between these two
properties, and that one of the tests frequently used to diagnose at-issueness in fact di-
agnoses only anaphoric availability. I argue that propositional anaphora and at-issueness
are distinct, showing that at-issueness is neither necessary nor sufficient to determine a
proposition‚Äôs anaphoric potential."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:39Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

BREASTFEEDING EXPERIENCES OF LOW INCOME WOMEN IN THREE SETTINGS
Joan Doyle Paddock
Cornell University, 2017
	The fact that the majority (53%) of infants in the US are born to women living at 185% of poverty or less who participate in the WIC program raises the stakes on any discussion of maternal and infant care for low income women. The importance of breastfeeding for infant development and the prevention of chronic diseases in later life underscores the significance of this opportunity to positively influence the health and wellbeing of a large and growing portion of the US population. However, in the US, low income and minority women are less likely to breastfeed. The papers in this dissertation examine aspects of breastfeeding support that are available for low income women in three different program settings: an urban, Baby Friendly Hospital, a nutrition education program, and a worksite where breastfeeding support policies had just been introduced. 
	In each setting, the changes made to support breastfeeding had a positive impact. For women delivering at a Baby Friendly Hospital, the supportive policies of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) resulted in breastfeeding discharge rate of 73%. Based on interviews, many women would not have initiated breastfeeding, or would have given up before discharge without the assistance of hospital based lactation consultants as required by the BFHI.  WIC peer counselors were the only community breastfeeding support reported. A broader system of community supports would be a benefit to low income women delivering in this setting. For women participating in the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP), peer support provided by EFNEP educators at home visits had an impact on breastfeeding duration. Women receiving home visits, on average, doubled the breastfeeding duration goals they had set at enrollment. Lastly, the implementation of employee policies in support of breastfeeding resulted in an increase in the overall breastfeeding rates from pre to post implementation (+9.35%), and an increase in breastfeeding after employees returned to work (+2%). Job position (academic vs hourly) remained a critical factor for women breastfeeding after return to work. Job position and associated privileges such as a private office or autonomy over one‚Äôs schedule are not easily mitigated. 
	Given the overwhelming benefits of breastfeeding in providing optimal nutrition for infants, the changes in each program have the potential to contribute to long term health of the infants they serve."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:42:01Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

A subset of neuroscientists I studied is now doing research with the explicit purpose of addressing poverty, adversity, and inequality. Their foundational claim is that experiences in the world and interactions with other people ‚Äì an ‚Äúenvironment of relationships‚Äù ‚Äì are integral in shaping brain development. I investigate how neuroscientists and policymakers produce scientific knowledge about the developing brain, and put forward a new sociotechnical vision for governance. Those involved in this project understand themselves as using science to advocate for a more just society that takes responsibility for the health and well being of its most vulnerable and disadvantaged citizens. Despite these good intentions, my neuroscientist interviewees found themselves at the center of controversy during their early careers. Critics from within the scientific community were worried that the research was based upon eugenicist and racist assumptions. The neuroscience community eventually accepted the work, and the controversy subsided. More recently, however, the studies have gotten wider coverage, and a similar strand of criticism, albeit from outside of the scientific community, has resurfaced.  
Through ethnographic methods, I studied the knowledge production and policymaking practices of this group, as well as the controversy that ensued and how my participants react to it. I pay close attention to the science-policy relationship, and show that building neuroscience-based policy requires extensive negotiation amongst actors, where they must contend with both social and scientific concerns. The production of a new narrative called the ‚ÄúBrain Story‚Äù exemplifies this process. I found that neuroscience brings new attention to age-old problems, and positions itself as a powerful new voice in the arena of early childhood development by pulling together discourses of science, economics, and our moral responsibility to children.  
I argue that the research is at once a reflection and repudiation of biomedical modes of analysis. Though this approach values biomedical evidence about the individual, scientists I interviewed believe that the best way to solve social problems is by intervening at the level of the social.

The intensification of water and N management is likely to increase the discharge volume and N load to sewers, and atmospheric deposition of heavy metals could compromise food safety. This has not been measured in full-scale rooftop farms and there is little information for land use planning to estimate the environmental and economic returns from rooftop farming. This study is located at the Brooklyn Grange, a 0.6-ha operational rooftop farm atop an 11-story building in New York City. I report the Grange‚Äôs balance for water, N, and heavy metals, and address how this balance could be improved in terms of environmental quality, resource use efficiency, and food safety. I found that the discharge volume to sewers was 1.1X the precipitation, and the Grange was a net source for water in the urban watershed. Depending on crop types, water use efficiency was lower than in-ground intensive vegetable production in dry regions, and over half of irrigation was wasted by drainage. Drainage N output was 11 X the atmospheric bulk deposition, and was 5.4X the estimated total atmospheric N deposition, which makes the Grange a net N source in the urban watershed. Fertilizer N input and N leaching loss from soil were similar, and efficiency of N management can be lower than in-ground intensive vegetable production. Efficiency of N and water management could be improved by increasing the soil water storage within the range of plant available water. Atmospheric deposition of Pb and Mn exceeded drainage outputs, and the Grange was a net sink for these metals in the urban environment respectively. There were unwashed vegetable samples exceeding guideline level for Pb, yet the Pb concentration for human consumption was likely to be lower because vegetables are machine-washed before sales. In order to reduce atmospheric deposition of Pb, it is important to cover the soil with mulch.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:47Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Disordered folliculogenesis in PCOS has long been characterized by three phenomena: (1) the accumulation of small follicles, (2) inhibition of follicular maturation, and (3) absence of follicular turnover. These defects presumably prevent ovulation, but have never been explored in vivo. An accurate understanding of antral follicle development in PCOS is critical to facilitate the diagnosis and identify targets for nutritional and pharmacologic interventions aimed at reinstating ovulation. The central objective of this dissertation was to characterize antral folliculogenesis in women with PCOS. In Part 1, we used serial ultrasonography to assess follicle growth and regression during a 4‚Äì5-week interval. Anovulatory cycles were considered in Chapter 1. We documented active components of follicle development amidst follicular excess in PCOS, and revealed that follicles become arrested at the mid-antral stage, but turnover more frequently than in normal ovaries. Sporadic ovulatory cycles were considered in Chapter 2. We observed earlier selection in women with PCOS than in regular ovulatory cycles and identified potential relationships between milder reproductive features and likelihood of sporadic ovulation. In Part 2, we began to explore the implications of disordered antral folliculogenesis on the diagnosis of PCOS and treatment of anovulation. The clinical utility of the sonographic criteria for PCOS were considered across the menstrual cycle in Chapter 3. We demonstrated that diagnostic markers of follicular excess are robust over time irrespective of cycle phase. Nutritional therapies for anovulation were reviewed in Chapter 4. We described the limitations of previous studies and identified opportunities for future research in the field. Collectively, this dissertation integrated ultrasonographic approaches from basic science to inform and improve the clinical management of women with PCOS.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:42Z (GMT).

colliders and hidden sectors. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is just starting
to reach its maximum operational capabilities. However, already with the current
data, large classes of models are being put under significant pressure. It is crucial
to understand whether the (thus far) null results are a consequence of a lack of
solution to the hierarchy problem around the weak scale or requires expanding
the search strategy employed at the LHC. It is the duty of the current generation
of physicists to design new searches to ensure that no stone is left unturned. To
this end, we study the sensitivity of the LHC to the couplings in the Standard
Model top sector. We find it can significantly improve the measurements on Zt R t R
coupling by a novel search strategy, making use of an implied unitarity violation
in such models. Analogously, we show that other couplings in the top sector can
also be measured with the same technique. Furthermore, we critically analyze a
set of anomalies in the LHC data and how they may appear from consistent UV
completions. We also propose a technique to measure lifetimes of new colored
particles with non-trivial spin.
While the high energy frontier will continue to take data, it is likely the only
collider of its kind for the next couple decades. On the other hand, low-energy
experiments have a promising future with many new proposed experiments to
probe the existence of particles well below the weak scale but with small couplings
to the Standard Model. In this work we survey the different possibilities, focusingon the constraints as well as possible new hidden sector dynamics. In particular,
we show that vector portals which couple to an anomalous current, e.g., baryon
number, are significantly constrained from flavor changing meson decays and rare Z
decays. Furthermore, we present a new mechanism for dark matter freezeout which
depletes the dark sector through an out-of-equilibrium decay into the Standard
Model."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:42:02Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This broad-scale sociometric study tracked multiple colony parameters, including worker and drone populations, comb area and use, swarming rate, and colony death.  This chapter forms the natural history foundation upon which future investigations were built.  
Chapter 2 (published in Naturwissenschaften) is about the colony parameters that trigger workers to begin building drone comb, the first reproductive investment.  By experimentally increasing individual colony parameters, we show that workers only begin to invest in reproduction once the colony surpasses a threshold colony size.  This led us to investigate how workers detect that their colony is above this reproductive threshold.    
Chapter 3 (published in the Journal of Experimental Biology) combined the observational with the experimental.  The goal of the observational study was to monitor and compare cues in small and large colonies to see which cues reliably change with colony size, and how.  In the experimental study, we manipulated three cues that workers might use to sense that their colony has enough workers to invest in drone comb: (1) worker density, (2) volatile pheromone level and (3) nest temperature.  We found that contact rate increases with colony size, and that worker density is less variable in large colonies.  When colonies were experimentally manipulated to increase worker density, worker bees responded by producing more drone comb.  This demonstrates that workers use worker density to assess colony size, although the mechanism that they use to assess worker density remains uncertain.  
Chapter 4 (published in Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology) used accelerometers to measure comb vibrations, while varying the number of bees on the comb.  While comb vibrations did decrease with increased worker number, the damping was not sufficiently large to cue workers of their colony‚Äôs size.  We did, however, show that it is not the bees‚Äô mass that damps vibrations, but is likely their behavior.  This damping may reduce background noise, and improve the comb landscape for substrate-borne communication."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:43Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Additionally, clouds should also support flexibility and efficiency, so that users can customize resource management policies and optimize performance and resource utilization. However, flexibility and efficiency are typically limited due to security requirements. This dissertation investigates the question of how to offer flexibility and efficiency as well as strong security in cloud infrastructures.
Specifically, this dissertation addresses two important platforms in cloud infrastructures: the containers and the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platforms. The containers platform supports efficient container provisioning and executing, but does not provide sufficient security and flexibility. Different containers share an operating system kernel which has a large attack surface, and kernel customization is generally not allowed. The IaaS platform supports secure sharing of cloud resources among mutually untrusted users, but does not provide sufficient flexibility and efficiency. Many powerful management primitives enabled by the underlying virtualization platform are hidden from users, such as live virtual machine migration and consolidation. 
The main contribution of this dissertation is the proposal of an approach inspired by the exokernel architecture that can be generalized to any multi-tenant system to improve security, flexibility, and efficiency. This approach is called the exokernel approach --- a principle of separating protection and management. By separating protection and management, the protection layer can focus on security isolation and resource multiplexing, making security guarantees easier to maintain and verify. Resource management components are dedicated to each user or application for customization and optimization, greatly improving flexibility and efficiency. We investigate the effectiveness of this approach by applying it to the containers and the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platforms, and introduce X-Containers and Library Cloud. X-Containers is a new exokernel+LibOS architecture that is fully compatible with Linux containers and provides competitive or superior performance to native Docker Containers as well as other LibOS designs. Library Cloud is a new abstraction that enables more flexible and efficient user-level cloud resource management without breaking security isolation between different users. Together, these systems represent important steps towards secure, flexible, and efficient cloud infrastructures."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:43Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Two approaches are especially powerful at linking these processes to patterns: mathematical modeling and using a citizen science dataset. This dissertation uses these two approaches to detect unobservable biological processes from observable patterns in three separate studies: monarch butterfly population dynamics in eastern United States, microbiota population dynamics in fly gut, and mating strategy dynamics in hybridizing species pairs. First, the dissertation tests whether a continental population decline of the monarch butterfly is caused by the scarcity of milkweed, as the milkweed decline has been shown to locally impact monarch population. The study concludes that the milkweed scarcity is not the cause of the continental monarch decline. An observation made at a microscopic scale cannot be extrapolated to explain the pattern at a macroscopic scale. Second, the dissertation develops novel method to understand population dynamics of ingested bacteria from fecal time-series taken from its host. Application of this method to experiments using Drosophila shows that bacterial population is regulated over larger gut area in the host as the density of bacteria increases. Information on processes at a microscopic scale may be preserved at a macroscopic scale. Third, the dissertation develops a model to understand how unequal population sizes between hybridizing species pairs influence the evolution of mate choosiness in these species. An observation of greater choosiness in a smaller population has often been interpreted as evidence for reinforcement, but our results suggest that this interpretation is not valid. Some microscopic processes may dominate others to generate macroscopic patterns. Lastly, this dissertation highlights the importance of scale not only in basic science, but also in applications such as conservation and medicine.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:42:03Z (GMT).

Yet in addition to transferring official powers, these efforts have introduced new spatial categories and legal techniques such as local conventions and village protected sites. These tools alter the terrain on which state agencies, politicians, commercial interests, and customary leaders ‚Äì not to mention the numerous groups whose livelihoods depend on these resources ‚Äì seek to access and control natural resources. By tracing the evolution of one of Senegal‚Äôs first community forestry initiatives over a 17-year history, this article argues that decentralization has fixed forests in place and privatized common-property, while also disrupting the presumption of separate domains of ‚Äústate‚Äù and ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù.  Rather than creating territories governed by communities, the creation of village forests drew together customary authorities, local politicians, and forestry technicians in relations of mutual dependence and informal collaboration. One effect of decentralization has been the incorporation of new resources and property relations into networks of informalized and privatized state power.

Collective entrepreneurship initiatives are arising as social activists seek to address sustainability challenges in their local communities through business means. Commensurate with the emergent nature of this phenomenon, I rely on qualitative studies of two examples of collective enterprise to inductively develop new theory in this nascent field of research. In particular, a study of Renewable Energy Source Cooperatives in the transitioning German energy sector puts forward new theory on how collective social entrepreneurship initiatives generate and sustain member participation. A study on Bio-Energy Village initiatives in the same market context develops theoretical insight into how such collective entrepreneurial ventures can move individuals to disrupt the extant institutional arrangements they have taken for granted. Collectively, these studies advance our understanding of how community-based, collective entrepreneurship can break with unsustainable consumption patterns of the past and generate unprecedented citizen involvement in change towards greater sustainability in established markets.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:46Z (GMT).

It identifies in the dominant culture a preoccupation with being overwhelmed by performances of black feminine agency, and this preoccupation is framed under the term ‚Äúnegra demais‚Äù which may be understood as so/too black and so/too female. This doubled significance reflects a pull between the pleasure experienced in fetishizing the black female body as a commodity of conquest and the paranoia felt over her potential to assert authority over her spectator. Such potential is taken to task through a study of 20th-21st century women-driven performances. 
Chapter One addresses a fixation with the black female subject through a close reading of Glauber Rocha‚Äôs directorial debut, Barravento. This chapter stresses the film‚Äôs concern with the feiti√ßo, or spell, exacted through the faith of Candombl√©, citing an analogous tension in the film‚Äôs visual and narrative management of female figures. Chapter Two studies public representations of Carolina Maria de Jesus that framed her as a symbol of Brazil‚Äôs race and class divide. This chapter traces how Jesus ‚Äúcreated scenes‚Äù across Brazil‚Äôs unsteady political landscape. Her eccentric and nonconformist performance of everyday life offers a counter-normative model that transgresses the limits of all categories assigned to her. The third chapter focuses on a movement against FIFA‚Äôs 2014 World Cup and the exclusion of a Salvador‚Äôs traditional street vendors, the baianas de acaraj√©, from Salvador‚Äôs Fonte Nova Stadium during the events. The methods of protest and mobilization employed in this movement are held against those of concurrent social uprisings to highlight the baianas‚Äô sense of embeddedness in the public spaces and the cultural fabric of their trade. The final chapter focuses on the reiterative nature of performance and visual returns to spectacular acts of violence exacted against black bodies. This chapter addresses the March 16, 2014 shooting and public dragging of Claudia Silva Ferreira by military police. The viral circulation of cellphone footage of Ferreira‚Äôs murder and a social media memorial project titled Cem Vezes Cl√°udia (One Hundred Times Claudia) shapes this analysis of the methods employed by resistant artists, performers, and media activists."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:41Z (GMT).

By focusing on the textual and cinematic representations in female-authored fiction and woman-centered films, I argue that female same-sex sentiment is primarily a psychological intimate relationship developed from the modern institution of education, in which women will try to avoid developing friendships with the opposite sex in order to maintain the virginity and the chastity that have historically been characterized by patriarchal censorship as moral codes for women. It helps the young female go through her social recasting of self-identification in the transitional stage from kin-inflected family to institutional-based society, and simultaneously convey her into a ‚Äúhomeward‚Äù journey of heterosexual marriage. It therefore reflects the integrity of heterosexual mechanics. 
On the other hand, this intimate relationship between women raises a suggestion of female homoeroticism. By shifting the focus from whether female same-sex sentiment is purely non-erotic or really homosexual to the questions of within which institution and in what language that this female intimate relationship becomes suggestive of being homosexual, I argue that its ‚Äúin-between‚Äù position lies in a lack of feminine discourse based on real gender differentials. The suspicion of homoeroticism in female same-sex sentimentality is neither a representation nor a confirmation of female homoeroticism. Rather, it is a reflection of woman‚Äôs self-awareness of not slipping into homosexuality that has been labelled as both physically illicit and mentally abnormal. Secondly, it is also a reflection of the fact that feminine pleasure has politically been conceptualized on the basis of masculine parameters and has to remain inarticulate in language.
In this sense, female same-sex sentimentality has destabilized the fixed boundary of the binary system of heterosexuality from within the monolithic discourse of masculine Oneness. It thematically performs women‚Äôs dynamic interacted-ness with the nation-state system, as well as the discursive (de)construction of gender as a man-made category brought by the new visions regarding the constitution of the subject, gender, and sex in the fields of feminism and gender studies."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:42Z (GMT).

I developed an approach to fabricating nanoscale thin film surface structures with periodicities on the order of 20 to 50 nm and with the capacity to localize reactions with small molecules and nanoparticles. A block copolymer (BCP) of polystyrene-block-poly[(allyl glycidyl ether)-co-(ethylene oxide)] (PS-b-P(AGE-co-EO)) is used to prepare periodically-ordered, reactive thin films. As proof-of-principle demonstrations of the versatility of the chemical functionalization, a small organic molecule, an amino acid, and ultrasmall silica nanoparticles are selectively attached via thiol-ene click chemistry to the exposed P(AGE-co-EO) domains of the BCP thin film. My approach employing click chemistry on the spatially confined reactive surfaces of a BCP thin film overcomes the solvent incompatibilities typically encountered when synthetic polymers are functionalized with water-soluble molecules. Moreover, this post-assembly functionalization of a reactive thin film surface preserves the original patterning, reduces the amount of required reactant, and leads to short reaction times. 
The small molecule functionalized area can subsequently template the confined crystallization of copper (I) oxide (Cu2O) and zinc oxide (ZnO) with high fidelity, from aqueous solutions at low temperatures (below 60 ¬∞C) with periodicities on the order of 50 nm. The demonstrated method provides a versatile materials platform to control the growth of nanostructured crystalline materials via the introduction of a plethora of surface functional groups. The resulting organic substrates can be used to template the growth and control the crystal orientation and texturing of multiple different crystalline inorganic materials on surfaces nanostructured via BCP self-assembly. The demonstrated approach is expected to provide a new materials platform in applications including sensing, catalysis, pattern recognition, or microelectronics."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:44Z (GMT).

This is an invariant of the symplectic form. The central theme of this thesis is computing the Gromov width of symplectic cuts. We do this for two classes of symplectic manifolds: four-dimensional toric manifolds and complex Grassmannian manifolds. Symplectic cutting results in symplectic manifolds of smaller volume. A natural question is whether the Gromov width decreases (or at least does not increase) under this operation. In this thesis we use symplectic embedding techniques and theory of J-holomorphic curves to establish lower and upper bounds on Gromov width. In the case of 4-dimensional toric symplectic manifolds, we answer the question positively for any symplectic cuts that result in smooth manifolds. We then compute the exact Gromov width of certain cuts of complex Grassmannians, again establishing the desired monotonicity.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:48Z (GMT).

In combination with high energy density metal anodes, metal/O2 batteries provide exceptional energy density capacity. By properly selecting a catalytic electrolyte for the cell and exploiting the nucleophilic properties of the superoxide, we demonstrate the ability to deploy the system for energy production and low-value chemicals upgrade/conversion.
The examined Al/O2 electrochemical system uses Al as the anode and an imidazolium-based ionic liquid/AlCl3 salt electrolyte. Compared to other high energy density metals, Al is more abundant, inherently safer to handle and has higher volumetric capacity. The selected electrolyte has been shown to complex with thermodynamically stable chemicals and catalyze their conversion.
Herein we report an Al/O2+CO2 electrochemical cell with the ability to capture and convert CO2 to useful C2 species, oxalate, while enhancing the discharge capacity of the cell.

F. verticillioides causes the disease Fusarium ear rot (FER) and produces the toxic fungal secondary metabolite (mycotoxin) fumonisin, which can reduce yields and marketability of maize grain. More importantly, fumonisin exposure is associated with health risks for humans and animals. This dissertation aimed to dissect the genetics and mechanisms conferring resistance to FER and fumonisin contamination in maize. Employing point and inundative F. verticillioides inoculation methods with a panel of 50 maize inbred lines, the symptomatology of F. verticillioides infection (FVI) was dissected, showing that kernel bulk density is an accurate predictor of fumonisin contamination in maize kernels. Quantitative trait locus mapping and correlation analyses further demonstrated the link between kernel bulk density and resistance to FVI and revealed the diverse modes of pathogenesis and resistance loci present in four tropical-by-temperate recombinant inbred line maize families. Inter-trait correlation analyses, genome-wide association mapping, and genomic prediction of 29 publicly available disease resistance (including FER) and morphophysiological traits on the maize core diversity panel revealed that height and inflorescence traits were associated and shared loci disease resistance.

The modeling of transport and rheology in such confined inhomogeneous soft materials requires an accurate description of the microscopic forces driving particle motion, such as entropic and hydrodynamic forces, and of particle interactions with nearby boundaries. Previous models of such micro-confined transport behavior had been limited primarily to a single particle inside a spherical cavity. Although attempts had been made prior to this work to extend such models to more than one confined particle, none had yet successfully accounted for the effects of hydrodynamics, owing to the difficulties of modeling many-body long-ranged interactions. To accurately model spherically confined suspensions, new far-field mobility functions are derived and, together with the appropriate near-field resistance functions, implemented in a Stokesian-dynamics like approach.  The method fully accounts for all many-body far-field interactions and near-field interactions both between the particles themselves and between particles and the enclosing cavity. Utilizing the newly developed method, we study short- and long- time self-diffusion at equilibrium, with a focus on the dependence of the former on particle positions relative to the cavity, and of both on volume fraction and size ratio.  It is found that the cavity exerts qualitative changes in transport behavior, such as a position dependent and anisotropic short-time self-diffusivity and anisotropic long-time transport behavior.  Such qualitative changes suggest that careful interpretation of experimental measurements in 3D confined suspensions requires accounting for such confinement induced behaviors.  To elucidate the effects of confinement on inter-particle hydrodynamic interactions, the method is utilized to determine the concentrated mobility of particles in the spherically confined domain. Confinement is found to induce qualitative changes in the functional dependence of particle entrainment with inter-particle separation. For widely separated particles, the functional dependence on inter-particle separation can be predicted via a Green's function.  How this behavior can be utilized to develop a more accurate framework for two-point microrheology measurements near confining boundaries is discussed.

Seventeen years prior to the 79 CE eruption that sealed the city, Pompeian citizens experienced an earthquake that disrupted the city‚Äôs water system. Over the course of the city‚Äôs remaining years, its people attempted to return the city to its former standards, including renovating public and private water systems and restoring the d√©cor of their homes. Were fountain paintings created when actual fountains could not be used? Using chi-square analysis to calculate the relationship between variables, the results indicates there is no statistically significant relationship between painted fountains and private water access. Instead, painted fountains represent a realistic representation of gardens as a psychological mechanism to bring order to the chaotic natural world in the aftermath of the earthquake.

Chapter 2 describes the implementation (with a careful eye towards parallelization) and applications of the recently developed heat-bath conÔ¨Åguration interaction (HCI) algorithm. HCI is a fast selected conÔ¨Åguration interaction plus perturbation theory method for Ô¨Ånding the exact energy of small, challenging systems within a given basis. Though it is faster than many alternatives, it is still an exponentially scaling algorithm; careful implementation and the use of parallel computing are necessary to study interesting systems. We describe the important implementation and parallelization details, along with providing performance results. We then apply the method to two interesting systems: solid silicon, as a benchmark for other quantum chemistry methods, and the binding curve of Cr2, which cannot be computed reliably by any of the other state of the art algorithms.  Chapter 3 concerns the modeling of the quantum dynamics of two, three, or four quantum dots in proximity to a plasmonic system such as a metal nanoparticle or an array of metal nanoparticles. For all systems, an initial state with only one quantum dot in its excited state evolves spontaneously into a state with entanglement between all pairs of QDs. The entanglement arises from the couplings of the QDs to the dissipative, plasmonic environment. Moreover, we predict that similarly entangled states can be generated in systems with appropriate geometries, starting in their ground states, by exciting the entire system with a single, ultrafast laser pulse. By using a series of repeated pulses, the system can also be prepared in an entangled state at an arbitrary time. Chapter 4 investigates systems of two or more quantum dots interacting with a dissipative plasmonic nanostructure by using a cavity quantum electrodynamics approach with a model Hamiltonian. We focus on determining and understanding system conÔ¨Ågurations that generate multiple bipartite quantum entanglements between the occupation states of the quantum dots. These conÔ¨Ågurations include allowing for the quantum dots to be asymmetrically coupled to the plasmonic system. Analytical solution of a simpliÔ¨Åed limit for an arbitrary number of quantum dots and numerical simulations and optimization for the two- and three-dot cases are used to develop guidelines for maximizing the bipartite entanglements. For any number of quantum dots, we show that through simple starting states and parameter guidelines, one quantum dot can be made to share a strong amount of bipartite entanglement with all other quantum dots in the system, while entangling all other pairs to a lesser degree.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:49Z (GMT).

The essential nutrient choline may mitigate some of these impairments, as suggested by data in humans and trophoblast cell culture. Choline is a precursor for several molecules with crucial roles during pregnancy: the methyl donor betaine, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and the phospholipid phosphatidylcholine. Through betaine, it participates in the metabolic network referred to as one-carbon metabolism which is essential for many biochemical processes including nucleotide synthesis, DNA methylation, and amino acid metabolism. Demand for one-carbon (methyl) nutrients, including choline, folate, and vitamin B-12, is high during pregnancy when cells of the placenta and fetus undergo rapid division. This dissertation research sought to examine the effects of choline supplementation during pregnancy in the Dlx3+/- mouse, a model of placental insufficiency.
Study 1 investigated the effects of maternal choline supplementation (MCS) on pregnancy outcomes in Dlx3+/- mice. This study demonstrated that maternal choline supplementation led to a marked increase in fetal growth by mid-gestation, which resulted in compensatory mechanisms to slow growth by downregulating Igf1. Placental betaine concentrations were strongly predictive of fetal weights, suggesting betaine supply may be a determinant of fetal growth.
Study 2 explored the effects of MCS on aspects of placental function in the Dlx3+/- mouse. The main findings indicate that a higher maternal choline intake can alter placental labyrinth size, modulate expression of angiogenic and inflammatory genes in the placenta, and decrease placental apoptosis; and that these effects occur in a fetal sex-dependent manner.
Study 3 assessed the effects of MCS on vitamin B-12 status in mice with and without placental insufficiency. In addition, data from a human feeding study was used to further explore this relationship. MCS increased the active form of vitamin B-12 in pregnant women; genetic variants that increase choline requirements were also shown to alter vitamin B-12 markers. 
Taken together, these studies suggest that higher levels of choline intake during pregnancy may be beneficial for the mother and fetus, and provide support for further research on the use of choline for improving placental function and mitigating placental insufficiency."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:46Z (GMT).

It promises, at least on paper, greater efficiency and higher accelerating gradients, with the potential to enable the construction of smaller yet more powerful accelerators than can be constructed using niobium. Although the state-of-the-art performance of cavities coated with Nb3Sn has shown great potential, the achievable limits in cavity quality factor Q0 and accelerating gradient Eacc are still below that expected given theoretical limits. In this work we present and discuss results of experiments carried out to understand the current limitations on Q0 and Eacc, and propose methods to improve these further. We will conclude with an outlook to the future, and the prospects that Nb3Sn could enable.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:42:05Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Wiesner, Ulrich B.||Kourkoutis, Lena Fitting	2018-10-22T17:23:50Z			5/30/18		Significant advances in the amount of electrical energy that can be stored in electrochemical cells, such as rechargeable batteries require the adoption of high energy metallic anodes including Li, Na, Al, Zn, etc. Such anodes introduce as significant technical challenges because they are known to form rough electrodeposits, loosely termed dendrites, during the device operation. This produces irreversible active material (electrode and electrolyte) losses during normal cell operation and poses safety concerns because the dendrites can proliferate in the inter-electrode space, shorting the cell internally. Though similar phenomenon has been investigated in the more conventional context of metal electroplating, more complex effects can dominate in a battery configuration especially at current densities below the limiting current and in cells where the metal anodes undergo chemical reaction with electrolyte components. In this thesis, a comprehensive materials strategy involving structural and interfacial engineering is pursued to stabilize lithium metal electrodeposition. The strategy is based on guidelines defined by a theoretical linear stability analysis of metal electrodeposition in structured electrolytes. The origin of deposition instability is revealed to involve fundamental features of electrolytes and interfaces near metal anodes, which lead to electro- convective, morphological and chemical instability. I show that the first two instabilities can be addressed by using a nanostructured polymer/ceramic hybrid electrolyte, which exhibits high conductivity, high modulus and the ability to rectify ion transport through confinement. The well-defined nanoporous structure of the electrolytes also confine the length scale of the electrodeposit, which allows surface tension and other weaker forces at the interface to flatten rough electrodeposits, promoting dendrite-free operation. The chemical instability poses a more serious challenge because it is intrinsic to the chemistry of the electrode and electrolyte components; any exposure of one to the other can in principle drive a reaction cascade that ends in unconstrained growth in the cell impedance and premature failure. I show that this challenge can be overcome by the careful design of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) that regulate mass transport of reactive electrolyte ingredients and at the same time are able to flex to accommodate volume expansion of the anode. A significant finding is that these features can be realized using electrolyte additives designed to selectively break-down in-situ to form SEI with explicit composition set by the chemistry of the additive. A particularly important example are additives that break down to form halogen salts, which exhibit low surface diffusion barrier and fast interfacial transport. Such materials are shown to be highly effective in improve battery cycle lifetime. A second category of SEI explored in the study are so- called artificial SEI formed by pretreating the metallic electrode with polymer, metals, and metal oxide precursors prior to cell assembly.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:50Z (GMT).

In this dissertation, I explore what phenotypes to measure when breeding for downy mildew resistance and improved floral scent and how to measure these phenotypes accurately and efficiently. Traditionally, downy mildew resistance has been measured by visually rating sporulation and hypersensitive response on leaves or leaf discs. However, such manual ratings become intractable when dealing with thousands of samples. Therefore, to measure sporulation on leaf discs, I developed a computer vision system that reduced phenotyping time by more than 90% when compared to manual ratings, and also was found to work well for phenotyping leaf trichomes. If phenotypes are collected in the vineyard, spatial variation from inoculum, soil, and microclimate might have an effect on these phenotypes. Testing this assumption, spatial processes explained some variance in vineyard phenotypes, but accounting for the spatial variance might not lead to significantly more accurate phenotypes. Quantitative phenotyping of floral scent for large numbers of grapevines using headspace analysis is not economically feasible, so I evaluated the robustness of a hexane extraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify floral volatiles and found that it was robust regardless of extraction time when flowers were sampled from the same inflorescence. After obtaining phenotypes and genotypes of vines, quantitative trait loci are found, traditionally using one phenotype at a time. In our case, understanding how sporulation, HR, and leaf trichomes affected each other was of interest, in addition to how genetic markers affected the phenotypes, so I used Bayesian networks to explore these interactions. In one of two F1 families studied, HR had a positive effect on sporulation, and leaf trichomes had a negative effect on both HR and sporulation, suggesting that leaf trichome density can be selected for in breeding for downy mildew disease resistance. A breeding project was started with the intention of creating a dwarf grapevine with an attractive floral scent. With a complementary interest to understand what volatile compounds were responsible for the various floral scents in grapevine, a diverse set of genotypes from various Vitis spp. were phenotyped for floral scent and volatiles, and it was found that similar scents were generated from different sesquiterpene profiles. Overall, this dissertation spans key concepts in the science of plant breeding, from parental selection and hybridization, to phenotyping by computer vision and chemical analysis, to statistical analyses of interacting phenotypes, genotypes, and spatial variability, with the findings possibly enhancing grapevine breeding strategies and execution.		12/18/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:42:07Z (GMT).

Following the Convention on Biological Diversity that granted nation states sovereign rights over nonhuman genetic resources and in line with the recent informational turn in biodiversity conservation, the last two decades saw the proliferation of national and international genebanks worldwide. This work has as its centerpiece one such national bank, the Turkish Seed Gene Bank (TSGB), where I conducted ethnographic fieldwork between 2013 and 2014.  I analyze in this dissertation the everyday workings of the TSGB with a view to understanding the polyvalent meanings of genebanking in Turkey at a time when species extinction and food security have emerged as global concerns due to climate change and biodiversity loss. In contrast with the universalist underpinnings of dominant conservation ideologies, I demonstrate how international access and benefit sharing agreements fall short of overcoming anxieties that stem from colonial and postcolonial histories of bioprospecting in Turkey. At the TSGB, I show that Bank employees remember, re-experience, and reinterpret these histories in everyday memory practices via personal and institutional narratives of loss. I argue that these narratives are also inextricably tied to a belief in capitalism‚Äôs futures, for in protecting Turkey‚Äôs plant biodiversity, the TSGB conservationists also long for a future when Turkey will have gained the capital and know-how to capitalize on the TSGB‚Äôs collection. In this everyday work of memory and historical commentary, I show that the TSGB naturalizes the nation on the one hand and nationalizes Nature on the other.  While recent studies have pointed out the biopolitical characteristic of conservation as an actionable science that systematizes and targets life processes, the meanings that are attached to life and survival in conservation institutions have largely been overlooked. I demonstrate in this dissertation how the TSGB conservationists establish an interspecies critique of life and latency as they measure the viability of seeds in cold storage in tandem with their own working lives in a politically volatile bureaucracy against more mobile and untethered versions of being alive. This interspecies critique that examines life both a concept and as qualified experience, I argue, does not only stand at odds with the universalist aspirations of conservation, but also points to a chasm between understandings of life and survival in the Anthropocene. Within the legal framework of international biodiversity conservation, I assert that the TSGB‚Äôs conservation politics does not represent a failure of conservation or a disregard for common human futures, but a postcolonial reimagining of what life in the Anthropocene should look like.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:50Z (GMT).

I examine how this site is variously enacted as a place of Wabanaki survivance and erasure and ask, how is it that a particular place with a particular history can be mobilized in different and even contradictory ways? I apply Annemarie Mol‚Äôs (2002) analytic concept of the body multiple to place to examine how utilize practices of storytelling, remembering, gathering, producing knowledge, and negotiating relationships to variously enact Norridgewock as a place multiple. I consider the multiple, overlapping, coexistent, and contradictory enactments of place and engagements with knowledge that shape place-worlds in settler colonial nation-states. Rather than taking these different enactments of place to be different perspectives on or versions of place, I examine how these enactments are embedded in and shaped by hierarchies of power and politics that produce enactments of place that are at times parallel and at times contradictory. Place-making is especially political in the context of settler colonialism, where indigenous places, histories, and peoples are erased in order to be replaced (Wolfe 2006; O‚ÄôBrien 2010). I consider how the social hierarches set up through settler colonialism make some enactments of place appear to be more important than others, or even appear as if they are the only enactments at all, rendering other ways of experiencing, knowing, and being in this place irrelevant or invisible. Using a decolonial approach, I unsettle the enactments of this place that produce and reproduce Wabanaki erasure narratives and show how, through stories, memories, and practices of gathering, Wabanaki peoples enact Norridgewock as simultaneously a site of violence and a site of their survivance and hope for the future.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:42:04Z (GMT).

From the postwar years through the 1960s, U.S. freeway plans catalyzed a public reckoning regarding the natures of cities. Government officials, urban dwellers, and designers and planners across the United States debated the infrastructures‚Äô placement, wrangling over the values of threatened sites and neighborhoods. Through these debates, prior conceptions of urban environments expanded to encompass the dynamic, living, and inter-relational dimensions of cities. This transformation took place via public discourse, and also through innovative design approaches, as architects, landscape architects, and urban designers engaged freeway designs as opportunities for technical and methodological experimentation. Mixing earlier generations‚Äô parkway visions and concerns for spatial experience with emergent cybernetic themes, data-driven analysis, scientific references, and anticipations of computerization, these explorative designs modeled natural forces in new ways, and at new scales.
The following chapters examine freeway projects by Lawrence Halprin, Kevin Lynch, Donald Appleyard, Christopher Alexander, Ian McHarg, and others, drawing on frameworks from environmental history and science and technology studies to interrogate how freeway design processes engaged public controversies and modeled human/nature relationships. The chapters advance in time and scale, showing how conceptualizations of the urban environment shifted with changes in drawing implements, uses of eyes and hands, inclusion and exclusion of data, and designers‚Äô understandings of their roles relative to living forces. The resulting fine-grained account charts how urban infrastructures, environmental ideas, and design practices evolved together from the mid 1950s through the late 1960s: tracking the evolution of urban environmentalism, elucidating sensorial aspects of freeways, and scrutinizing the political advantages and cultural complications of visualizing landscapes through data-based quantification.
This text makes designers‚Äô roles in environmental movements more accessible to a broad range of scholars. It contributes to an emerging transdisciplinary discourse regarding environmental histories of design, and forges new ground at the intersection of literatures on ecological design, architectural drawing and making, urban environmental history, and science and technology studies. Above all, it articulates what is at stake ‚Äì socially, politically, and environmentally ‚Äì in how designers engage the many skilled actions of designing."

words like that and so can be used to refer anaphorically to a proposition introduced in a
discourse: That‚Äôs true; She told me so. Much has been written about individual anaphora,
but less attention has been paid to propositional anaphora. This dissertation is a com-
prehensive examination of propositional anaphora, which I argue behaves like anaphora
in other domains, is conditioned by semantic factors, and is not conditioned by purely
syntactic factors nor by the at-issue status of a proposition.
I begin by introducing the concepts of anaphora and propositions, and then I discuss
the various words of English which can have this function: this, that, it, which, so, as, and
the null complement anaphor. I then compare anaphora to propositions with anaphora
in other domains, including individual, temporal, and modal anaphora. I show that the
same features which are characteristic of these other domains are exhibited by proposi-
tional anaphora as well.
I then present data on a wide variety of syntactic constructions‚Äîincluding sub-
clausal, monoclausal, multiclausal, and multisentential constructions‚Äînoting which li-
cense anaphoric reference to propositions. On the basis of this expanded empirical do-
main, I argue that anaphoric reference to a proposition is licensed not by any syntactic
category or movement but rather by the operators which take propositions as arguments.
With this generalization in hand, I turn to how such facts can be formally modeled: I
review existing systems which track anaphora and/or which make use of propositional
variables, and then introduce a new formalism which incorporates insights from these
existing systems.
Finally, I turn to the interaction between a proposition‚Äôs availability for anaphoric ref-
erence and its discourse status (in particular, its at-issue status). Contrary to the prevail-
ing assumption in the literature, I argue that there is no tight linking between these two
properties, and that one of the tests frequently used to diagnose at-issueness in fact di-
agnoses only anaphoric availability. I argue that propositional anaphora and at-issueness
are distinct, showing that at-issueness is neither necessary nor sufficient to determine a
proposition‚Äôs anaphoric potential."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:42:06Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The introduction of the various particles, especially nanoparticles, results in significantly altered microstructure (grain size and morphology). The target metal particles or mixtures of particles are aerosolized first and carried into the molten metal for alloying.  Cast iron and 1018 steel are chosen as the raw materials while metal powders (Ti, W, Nb) with different size scale (micron and nano-scale) are alloyed into the molten metals through different approaches (regular alloying and aerosol technology). Compared to the alloys produced by conventional metallurgy (regular alloying and regular size particles), the new alloys exhibit significantly altered microstructures and refinement of grain size, and much better uniform distribution as observed with EDS element mapping. The experiments confirm that the nanoparticle-aerosol technology is a promising approach with good versatility and can realize excellent dispersion of alloyed agents even with trace amount of injection. Moreover, this approach is shown to be more advantageous over conventional metallurgy and seems to have potential in industrial applications.

Figuring out an efficient method to dynamically forecast the hurricane evacuation demand with high accuracy plays a crucial role in preparedness work of hurricane management.  Recently, substantial studies and research exit on understanding hurricane evacuation behavior. However, in this thesis, some forecast covariates which were not mentioned before, are introduced into the prediction of hurricane evacuation rate. Moreover, two travel demand models are applied in this study: A Sequential Logit Model and a Cox proportional hazards model. These two models are used for estimating the probability of each household to evacuate in the specific time step. After applying the data from Hurricane Gustav (2008) in Louisiana, over 76% households‚Äô dynamic evacuation behavior are predicted correctly.

Through the lens of machine learning and machine vision, this thesis focuses on approaches of learning representations of web-scale data in perspectives of web user interaction and web content comprehension.
This thesis work contributes to the field of machine learning in both algorithmic foundations and practical advances. The first part focuses on classification and prediction problems on the web when the interactions of individuals are modeled by graphs. We will leverage graphs and machine learning models as tools to effectively represent how users' interactions are related to each other, and to identify interesting patterns of behavior of web users. The second part of the thesis focuses on methods for  understanding and comprehending visual contents on the web. In particular, we turn to deep learning -- a subfield of machine learning that has recently been placed at the core of many web-driven tasks such as image classification and understanding. Despite its success, there has been lacking understanding of the representations learned by deep neural networks. This thesis sheds light on how we can be better interpret the inner representations of deep neural networks, and also leads to new techniques of how we can facilitate learning better representations."

While some research has investigated the public‚Äôs reaction to various management practices, few have focused on intensive habitat management contexts. Individuals‚Äô reactions to the use of active management practices have serious implications for nature preserves as the public‚Äôs discontent with active management has previously delayed or impeded restoration work that led to a decline in ecosystem health. This thesis aims to explore how the use of active management practices influences individuals‚Äô affective response to the managed landscape, level of attachment to the preserve, and intention to perform place-protective behaviors. Additionally, we quantitively examine the influence of other factors (i.e. knowledge, attitudes, perceived risk, responsibility, and identity) on individuals‚Äô intention to perform place-protective behaviors.

Hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) has fulfilled that need by providing a substrate free of dangling bonds, low levels of corrugation and excellent thermal and chemical stability. However, hBN itself is quite an intriguing material and has been somewhat neglected within the 2D family. Its wide bandgap allows for DUV emission in the UVC range which is critical for water sanitation and biological and chemical process‚Äô. It has also been shown to host photoactive defects which can emit single photons paving the way for the creation of solid state single photon emitters, something that has proven impossible until now. Due to these reasons it‚Äôs imperative that fundamental research into hBN‚Äôs synthesis as well as its electronic and optical properties be conducted. With regards to the growth of hBN our main focus is on the popular CVD method, however, recently other methods are also underway (MBE, LPE, etc‚Ä¶). In this regard, hBN growth has lagged Graphene (Gr) where millimeter (mm) sized single crystals have already been demonstrated. We show that this feat can also be accomplished in hBN through a variety of optimization schemes where single crystals up to 0.3mm where synthesized. We also focus on the proposed growth mechanisms and difficulties of growing thick layered hBN via CVD. With regards to its electronic properties we report the demonstration of high mobility devices where our CVD grown hBN was used as the conductive channel. This is unprecedented in the scheme of 2D‚Äôs since hBN has been widely regarded to be insulating. We explore the possible doping mechanisms in our grown films and also give possible reasons why our material is conductive while the exfoliated films used by the majority of researchers in the field are not. Finally, we note that our work is only the beginning of what may be an incredibly exciting field of transport in wide band-gap 2D materials since 2D GaN has also recently synthesized which possesses a bandgap similar to hBN. We are also only the first of very few reports of large single crystal hBN films and hope that this will open the doors to studying the high-quality growth of hBN monolayers and multilayers similar to what happened with Gr. The field of 2D materials would greatly benefit from the wide availability of high quality large single crystal hBN, since this would avoid grain boundaries and other defects in hBN that would degrade its use as a substrate.

Currently, low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used to photograph and map large areas at centimeter-scale resolution, and already are starting to be used by vector control personnel to efficiently locate mosquito habitat. However, post-processing of UAV images is still time intensive, often done manually, or with programs built for satellite imagery. Moreover, UAVs have never previously been used to assess habitat suitability in the more populated areas preferred by Aedes albopictus, a species that breeds primarily in standing water in artificial containers near human populations. This work explored the use of UAVs and convolutional neural for integrated mosquito management. 
Two neighborhoods comprising 125 houses in a densely-populated area of southern New York, were surveyed over nine days in 2017 with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV survey coincided with an entomological survey, which was conducted on a subset of the houses to establish the presence and distribution of mosquito species. 64% the of 629 containers surveyed on all properties could be seen from the UAV, with almost 2,000 more features were identified the images (e.g. from houses that were not surveyed). In total, more than 2500 objects of interest (containers suitable mosquito habitat or related features) were identified in the aerial photographs. Two previously-published neural network architectures were trained on this novel set of UAV¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨ aerial imagery. Single Shot Multibox Detection was used for image segmentation, achieving an average precision of 59%, a recall of 35%, and an overall accuracy of 31%. Separately, a fully convolutional neural net based on the VGG16 architecture, initiated with ImageNet weights and finetuned on images of surveyed properties assigned as positive or negative for Ae. albopictus larvae, achieved a binary classification of 80%.
When combined with image segmentation neural networks, unmanned aerial vehicles show promise for identifying potential habitat for Ae. albopictus, increasing the ability of vector control personnel to manage mosquito populat¬¨¬¨ions. The neural networks‚Äô abilities to predict larval presence could be further advanced by expanding training datasets, especially where containers of interest may vary by neighborhood."

Pilocarpus, a Neotropical genus in Rutaceae (Citrus Family) most notably known as the main source of pilocarpine for the treatment of glaucoma, is a chemically diverse genus rich in alkaloids, terpenoids and coumarins. An overharvesting of Pilocarpus microphyllus has led to near extinction of natural populations of this species; therefore, alternative sources of pilocarpine in other species, as well as an understanding of the important factors associated with increases in compound yields would greatly help reduce this destruction and maintain diversity.  The main aim of this research was to elucidate how phylogenetic relationships and adaptation to environmental variation shape phytochemical diversity in Pilocarpus. Phylogenetic regression models determined that phylogeny was better at predicting chemical traits when compared to models that only included certain bioclimatic factors. In addition, ecological niche models were used to determine the bioclimatic factors that contribute most to species distribution, including the identification of a large probability for niche overlap between species. Ancestral niche reconstruction identified geographically defined clades, as well as a potential tropical origin for the Pilocarpus clade. Next, an ecometabolomic analysis of P. pennatifolius revealed environmental variables correlated with alkaloid and phenolic variation. Finally, a population study on P. pennatifolius, P. spicatus, and P. riedelianus discovered significant differences in the genetic diversity and structure of these wild populations. Studies utilizing both environmental and phylogenetic factors are essential to tease out the intricate processes in the evolution of chemical diversity in plants. These methods can benefit fields such as conservation management, ecology, and evolutionary biology.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:52Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 2

Disordered folliculogenesis in PCOS has long been characterized by three phenomena: (1) the accumulation of small follicles, (2) inhibition of follicular maturation, and (3) absence of follicular turnover. These defects presumably prevent ovulation, but have never been explored in vivo. An accurate understanding of antral follicle development in PCOS is critical to facilitate the diagnosis and identify targets for nutritional and pharmacologic interventions aimed at reinstating ovulation. The central objective of this dissertation was to characterize antral folliculogenesis in women with PCOS. In Part 1, we used serial ultrasonography to assess follicle growth and regression during a 4‚Äì5-week interval. Anovulatory cycles were considered in Chapter 1. We documented active components of follicle development amidst follicular excess in PCOS, and revealed that follicles become arrested at the mid-antral stage, but turnover more frequently than in normal ovaries. Sporadic ovulatory cycles were considered in Chapter 2. We observed earlier selection in women with PCOS than in regular ovulatory cycles and identified potential relationships between milder reproductive features and likelihood of sporadic ovulation. In Part 2, we began to explore the implications of disordered antral folliculogenesis on the diagnosis of PCOS and treatment of anovulation. The clinical utility of the sonographic criteria for PCOS were considered across the menstrual cycle in Chapter 3. We demonstrated that diagnostic markers of follicular excess are robust over time irrespective of cycle phase. Nutritional therapies for anovulation were reviewed in Chapter 4. We described the limitations of previous studies and identified opportunities for future research in the field. Collectively, this dissertation integrated ultrasonographic approaches from basic science to inform and improve the clinical management of women with PCOS.		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:42:09Z (GMT).

This broad-scale sociometric study tracked multiple colony parameters, including worker and drone populations, comb area and use, swarming rate, and colony death.  This chapter forms the natural history foundation upon which future investigations were built.  
Chapter 2 (published in Naturwissenschaften) is about the colony parameters that trigger workers to begin building drone comb, the first reproductive investment.  By experimentally increasing individual colony parameters, we show that workers only begin to invest in reproduction once the colony surpasses a threshold colony size.  This led us to investigate how workers detect that their colony is above this reproductive threshold.    
Chapter 3 (published in the Journal of Experimental Biology) combined the observational with the experimental.  The goal of the observational study was to monitor and compare cues in small and large colonies to see which cues reliably change with colony size, and how.  In the experimental study, we manipulated three cues that workers might use to sense that their colony has enough workers to invest in drone comb: (1) worker density, (2) volatile pheromone level and (3) nest temperature.  We found that contact rate increases with colony size, and that worker density is less variable in large colonies.  When colonies were experimentally manipulated to increase worker density, worker bees responded by producing more drone comb.  This demonstrates that workers use worker density to assess colony size, although the mechanism that they use to assess worker density remains uncertain.  
Chapter 4 (published in Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology) used accelerometers to measure comb vibrations, while varying the number of bees on the comb.  While comb vibrations did decrease with increased worker number, the damping was not sufficiently large to cue workers of their colony‚Äôs size.  We did, however, show that it is not the bees‚Äô mass that damps vibrations, but is likely their behavior.  This damping may reduce background noise, and improve the comb landscape for substrate-borne communication."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:42:10Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

These applications can be used in a wide range of fields, such as military, security, biomedical analysis, material science, astronomy, etc. Unfortunately, utilizing these frequency bands is very challenging due to the notorious ‚Äùterahertz gap‚Äù. Consequently, current terahertz systems are very bulky and expensive, sometimes even require cryogenic conditions. Silicon terahertz electronics now becomes very attractive, since it can achieve significantly lower cost and make portable consumer terahertz devices feasible. However, due to the limited device fmax and low breakdown voltage, signal generation and processing on silicon platform in this frequency range is challenging. This thesis aims to tackle these challenges and implement high-performance terahertz systems. First of all, the devices are investigated under the terahertz frequency range and optimum termination conditions for maximizing the efficacy of the devices is derived. Then, novel passive surrounding networks are designed to provide the devices with the optimal termination conditions to push the performances of the terahertz circuit blocks. Finally, the high-performance circuit blocks are used to build terahertz systems, and system-level innovations are also proposed to push the state of the art forward. In Chapter 2, using a device-centric bottom-up design method, a 210-GHz harmonic oscillator is designed. With the parasitic tuning mechanism, a wide frequency tuning range is achieved without using lossy varactors. A passive network based on the return-path gap coupler and self-feeding structure is also designed to provide optimal terminations for the active devices to maximize the harmonic power generation. Fabricated with a 0.13-um SiGe BiCMOS process, the oscillator is highly compact with a core size of only 290x95 um2. The output frequency can be tuned from 197.5 GHz to 219.7 GHz, which is around 10.6% compared to the center frequency. It also achieves a peak output power and dc-to-RF efficiency of 1.4 dBm and 2.4%, respectively. The measured output phase noise at 1 MHz offset is -87.5 dBc/Hz. The high power, wide tuning range, low phase noise, as well as compact size, make this oscillator very suitable for terahertz systems integration. In Chapter 3, the design of a 320-GHz fully-integrated terahertz imaging system is described. The system is composed of a phase-locked high-power transmitter and a coherent high-sensitivity subharmonic-mixing receiver, which are fabricated using a 0.13-um SiGe BiCMOS technology. To enhance the imaging sensitivity, a heterodyne coherent detection scheme is utilized. To obtain frequency coherency, fully-integrated phase-locked loops are implemented on both the transmitter and receiver chips. According to the measurement, consuming a total dc power of 605 mW, the transmitter chip achieves a peak radiated power of 2 mW and a peak EIRP of 21.1 dBm. The receiver chip achieves an equivalent incoherent responsivity of more than 7.26 MV/W and a sensitivity of 70.1 pW under an integration bandwidth of 1 kHz, with a total dc power consumption of 117 mW. The achieved sensitivity with this proposed coherent imaging transceiver is around ten times better compared with other state-of-the-art incoherent imagers. In Chapter 4, a spatial-orthogonal ASK transmitter architecture for high-speed terahertz wireless communication is presented. The self-sustaining oscillator-based transmitter architecture has an ultra-compact size and excellent power efficiency. With the proposed high-speed constant-load switch, significantly reduced modulation loss is achieved. Using polarization diversity and multi-level modulation, the throughput is largely enhanced. Array configuration is also adopted to enhance the link budget for higher signal quality and longer communication range. Fabricated in a 0.13-um SiGe BiCMOS technology, the 220-GHz transmitter prototype achieves an EIRP of 21 dBm and dc-to- THz-radiation efficiency of 0.7% in each spatial channel. A 24.4-Gb/s total data rate over a 10-cm communication range is demonstrated. With an external Teflon lens system, the demonstrated communication range is further extended to 52 cm. Compared with prior art, this prototype demonstrates much higher transmitter efficiency.  In Chapter 5, an entirely-on-chip frequency-stabilization feedback mechanism is proposed, which avoids the use of both frequency dividers and off-chip references, achieving much lower system integration cost and power consumption. Using this mechanism, a 301.7-to-331.8-GHz source prototype is designed in a 0.13-um SiGe BiCMOS technology. According to the measurement, the source consumes a dc power of only 51.7 mW. The output phase noise is -71.1 and -75.2 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz and 1 MHz offset, respectively. A -13.9-dBm probed output power is also achieved. Overall, the prototype source demonstrates the largest output frequency range and lowest power consumption while achieving comparable phase noise and output power performances with respect to the state of the art. All the designs demonstrated in this thesis achieve good performances and push the state of the art forward, paving the way for implementation of more sophisticated terahertz circuits and systems for future applications.		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:53Z (GMT).

However, the standard practice of bare soil under vines exacerbates the vigor problem. Previous studies found that using under-vine cover crops reduced vine vigor in young vineyards but had little to no impact on mature vines. Wine sensory properties were impacted by under-vine cover crops although the cause was not clear. A study conducted in a mature Cabernet franc (Vitis vinifera L.) vineyard in the Finger Lakes region showed that chicory was the most effective cover crop to consistently reduce pruning weight and canopy leaf layer number without reducing yield compared to glyphosate maintained bare soil, whereas other under-vine cover crop treatments were not as consistent. In a three year study conducted in a mature Riesling (Vitis vinifera L.) vineyard, under-vine natural vegetation reduced vine canopy leaf layers and occlusion layers in one of the years compared to glyphosate maintained bare soil but there were no detectable sensory differences among wines from different under-vine floor treatments in any year. Profiling of soil microbiome using high-throughput sequencing showed that microbial community of natural vegetation diverged from the cultivation and glyphosate maintained treatments. However, no corresponding change in fungal community structure was observed on grapes or in simulated spontaneous fermentations. Undiscernible wine sensory properties also confirmed the lack of treatment effects in wines. Although under-vine cover crops impact on vine vegetative growth varied, no reduction in yield suggested that under-vine cover crops could serve as beneficial alternatives to bare soil for sustainable vineyard management. Further studies on how under-vine cover crops impact wine sensory properties are required to evaluate their practical adoptability.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:52Z (GMT).

It identifies in the dominant culture a preoccupation with being overwhelmed by performances of black feminine agency, and this preoccupation is framed under the term ‚Äúnegra demais‚Äù which may be understood as so/too black and so/too female. This doubled significance reflects a pull between the pleasure experienced in fetishizing the black female body as a commodity of conquest and the paranoia felt over her potential to assert authority over her spectator. Such potential is taken to task through a study of 20th-21st century women-driven performances. 
Chapter One addresses a fixation with the black female subject through a close reading of Glauber Rocha‚Äôs directorial debut, Barravento. This chapter stresses the film‚Äôs concern with the feiti√ßo, or spell, exacted through the faith of Candombl√©, citing an analogous tension in the film‚Äôs visual and narrative management of female figures. Chapter Two studies public representations of Carolina Maria de Jesus that framed her as a symbol of Brazil‚Äôs race and class divide. This chapter traces how Jesus ‚Äúcreated scenes‚Äù across Brazil‚Äôs unsteady political landscape. Her eccentric and nonconformist performance of everyday life offers a counter-normative model that transgresses the limits of all categories assigned to her. The third chapter focuses on a movement against FIFA‚Äôs 2014 World Cup and the exclusion of a Salvador‚Äôs traditional street vendors, the baianas de acaraj√©, from Salvador‚Äôs Fonte Nova Stadium during the events. The methods of protest and mobilization employed in this movement are held against those of concurrent social uprisings to highlight the baianas‚Äô sense of embeddedness in the public spaces and the cultural fabric of their trade. The final chapter focuses on the reiterative nature of performance and visual returns to spectacular acts of violence exacted against black bodies. This chapter addresses the March 16, 2014 shooting and public dragging of Claudia Silva Ferreira by military police. The viral circulation of cellphone footage of Ferreira‚Äôs murder and a social media memorial project titled Cem Vezes Cl√°udia (One Hundred Times Claudia) shapes this analysis of the methods employed by resistant artists, performers, and media activists."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:42:08Z (GMT).

By focusing on the textual and cinematic representations in female-authored fiction and woman-centered films, I argue that female same-sex sentiment is primarily a psychological intimate relationship developed from the modern institution of education, in which women will try to avoid developing friendships with the opposite sex in order to maintain the virginity and the chastity that have historically been characterized by patriarchal censorship as moral codes for women. It helps the young female go through her social recasting of self-identification in the transitional stage from kin-inflected family to institutional-based society, and simultaneously convey her into a ‚Äúhomeward‚Äù journey of heterosexual marriage. It therefore reflects the integrity of heterosexual mechanics. 
On the other hand, this intimate relationship between women raises a suggestion of female homoeroticism. By shifting the focus from whether female same-sex sentiment is purely non-erotic or really homosexual to the questions of within which institution and in what language that this female intimate relationship becomes suggestive of being homosexual, I argue that its ‚Äúin-between‚Äù position lies in a lack of feminine discourse based on real gender differentials. The suspicion of homoeroticism in female same-sex sentimentality is neither a representation nor a confirmation of female homoeroticism. Rather, it is a reflection of woman‚Äôs self-awareness of not slipping into homosexuality that has been labelled as both physically illicit and mentally abnormal. Secondly, it is also a reflection of the fact that feminine pleasure has politically been conceptualized on the basis of masculine parameters and has to remain inarticulate in language.
In this sense, female same-sex sentimentality has destabilized the fixed boundary of the binary system of heterosexuality from within the monolithic discourse of masculine Oneness. It thematically performs women‚Äôs dynamic interacted-ness with the nation-state system, as well as the discursive (de)construction of gender as a man-made category brought by the new visions regarding the constitution of the subject, gender, and sex in the fields of feminism and gender studies."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:42:09Z (GMT).

Of the many factors, the tissue microenvironment is increasingly appreciated for its crucial role in tumor initiation, progression, recurrence, and treatment response. The microvasculature is a critical determinant of tissue perfusion, with important consequences for cellular metabolism, drug delivery, and metastasis. To better understand how tissue perfusion contributes to tumor malignancy, I fabricated microphysiological in vitro models of the tumor-vascular microenvironment and assessed the differential regulation of tumor hypoxia response in 2D versus 3D culture. Results from these studies point to the value of tissue engineering approaches for deciphering the interdependence between cancer cells and their vascular microenvironment. 
Laboratory-based research provides important insights on the biological mechanisms of disease, and these basic sciences approaches are strengthened by a broad understanding of the human and social dimensions of cancer. To this end, I helped initiate and sustain a community-based partnership that fosters dialogue between cancer patients and scientists. The partnership enables the mutual exchange of knowledge and experience across the community-campus boundary. This project led to several major outcomes, including a monthly seminar for non-academic audiences, a certificate program for public engagement, an undergraduate writing class about cancer, and several avenues for informal science education. The patient-researcher partnership has a sustained impact in graduate and postdoctoral training at Cornell and provides a valuable forum to our local cancer community."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:50Z (GMT).

Additionally, clouds should also support flexibility and efficiency, so that users can customize resource management policies and optimize performance and resource utilization. However, flexibility and efficiency are typically limited due to security requirements. This dissertation investigates the question of how to offer flexibility and efficiency as well as strong security in cloud infrastructures.
Specifically, this dissertation addresses two important platforms in cloud infrastructures: the containers and the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platforms. The containers platform supports efficient container provisioning and executing, but does not provide sufficient security and flexibility. Different containers share an operating system kernel which has a large attack surface, and kernel customization is generally not allowed. The IaaS platform supports secure sharing of cloud resources among mutually untrusted users, but does not provide sufficient flexibility and efficiency. Many powerful management primitives enabled by the underlying virtualization platform are hidden from users, such as live virtual machine migration and consolidation. 
The main contribution of this dissertation is the proposal of an approach inspired by the exokernel architecture that can be generalized to any multi-tenant system to improve security, flexibility, and efficiency. This approach is called the exokernel approach --- a principle of separating protection and management. By separating protection and management, the protection layer can focus on security isolation and resource multiplexing, making security guarantees easier to maintain and verify. Resource management components are dedicated to each user or application for customization and optimization, greatly improving flexibility and efficiency. We investigate the effectiveness of this approach by applying it to the containers and the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platforms, and introduce X-Containers and Library Cloud. X-Containers is a new exokernel+LibOS architecture that is fully compatible with Linux containers and provides competitive or superior performance to native Docker Containers as well as other LibOS designs. Library Cloud is a new abstraction that enables more flexible and efficient user-level cloud resource management without breaking security isolation between different users. Together, these systems represent important steps towards secure, flexible, and efficient cloud infrastructures."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:42:10Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Increased intake of fruits and vegetables has been suggested to be one of major dietary factors reducing the risk of breast cancer. The health benefits were largely attributed to phytochemicals in fruits and vegetables. Ursolic acid (UA), a widely-distributed triterpenoid in fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices, has been reported to have anti-cancer activities. However, its mechanism of actions against breast cancer remain unclear.
 
The hypothesis of this study is that UA inhibits proliferation and invasion of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells via regulating cellular signal transduction pathways. Specific objectives are designed as: a) to investigate anti-proliferation and anti-invasion effects of UA in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells; b) To determine specific molecular targets of UA on cellular signal transduction pathways in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells; and c) to investigate potential synergistic effects of combining ursolic acid with paclitaxel toward breast cancer proliferation.
 
UA significantly inhibited proliferation of MDA-MDB-231 human breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner at the concentrations without cytotoxicity. The EC50 value of anti-proliferative activity was 30.67 ¬µM. UA at concentrations of 20, 30, and 40 ¬µM significantly inhibited cell invasion. Additional tests associated anti-invasion activity of UA with antagonizing the stimulation of EGF.
 
UA affected 8 targeted proteins in cellular signaling pathway in primary signaling screening. Akt, mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways were involved. Western blots indicated UA significantly downregulated EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation, which was correlated with reported inhibitory effects of UA on EGF-induced invasion. UA inhibited JAK/STAT3 and Akt activation, and downregulated NF-Œ∫B expression and activation.
 
UA, paclitaxel and their combination significantly inhibited proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Synergistic effect was observed at 95% inhibition rate in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and at 50% inhibition rate in MCF7 cells.
 
We demonstrated that UA exhibited inhibitory activity toward proliferation and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells via regulating cell signaling pathways. These data shed light on understanding the protective activity of plant foods against breast cancer."		12/31/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:50Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We focused on two main research questions: 1) How to design smart information schemes for decentralizing better (e.g., more efficient, stable and sustainable) flow patterns on transportation networks (Chapter 1 & 2); and 2) How to utilize information and system data fully and efficiently for  better (e.g., closer to optimal and more cost-effective) centralized decision making (Chapter 3 & 4). Specifically, we have explored the following four dimensions 1) Strategic information scheme design for enforcing optimal flow on traffic networks with minimal tolls. We explored how disclosing flexible new information can help reduce the toll intensity needed for decentralizing a Nash equilibrium on a general traffic network that minimizes certain system-level cost. We formulated the Minimal Toll Information Design Problem (MTIDP) and designed efficient  algorithms for finding near-optimal solutions to the problem. Numerical examples are used to reveal insights of MTIDP and validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution algorithms.  2) Remedy of the negative effect of inaccurate travel time estimate on dynamic routing using additional endogenous information feedback. We proposed to provide en-route real-time traffic-sensitive pollution information to drivers for suppressing traffic oscillations caused by delay in travel time reporting. Theoretical analysis (based on a novel queueing model), numerical examples, and simulation experiments for simple traffic networks are adopted to demonstrate the potential traffic stabilizing benefit of this new information.  3) Utilization of system data and demand forecast for controlling complex human-centered infrastructure systems.  We used multi-access managed lanes systems as an illustrative application. With the available measurement of traffic condition and demand forecast, we developed a hybrid model predictive control based dynamic pricing algorithm using origin-destination specific tolls. Through proper formulation of system models and practical constraints, the proposed control model can be implemented efficiently in real-time. 4) Value of information and optimal learning in solving large scale network optimization problems with uncertainty. We looked at the challenging second-best network pricing problem (SNPP) with stochastic demand. We designed Bayesian learning model for the problem and tailored linear belief-based Knowledge Gradient sampling policy to SNPP. Experiment on a benchmark network with more than a million candidate solutions showed superior performance of our approach to the benchmark heuristic.  We have proposed novel methodology and generated new insights in each dimension, concrete examples are involved. Our goal is to provide useful references, practical solutions and new thinking for existent nontrivial problems and emerging challenges in traffic management under this information age and unprecedented demand for efficient and sustainable urban mobility.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:54Z (GMT).

Such photonic devices are the most powerful because they can be manufactured at incredible scale, allowing us to either build them very cheaply or build large systems of photonic components, much like transistors and large-scale integrated circuits.  In this dissertation we make a leapfrog improvement in the state of the art of silicon photonics in two different areas: dramatically improving the performance of modulators using graphene and building large-scale silicon optical phased arrays with record-breaking efficiency and output beam quality.
	
The dissertation is divided into five chapters.  In the first, I introduce silicon photonics, discuss its capabilities and limitations, and summarize the key results of the dissertation.  In Chapter 2, I lay a theoretical framework for on-chip waveguides and ring resonators with a mathematical notation used throughout the thesis, as well as derive Fourier optics of optical phased arrays from first-principle scattering theory.  Chapter 3 details work on graphene ring modulators, including extensive fabrication and measurement details.  Chapter 4 continues with theoretical and experimental models of using graphene for highly linear and purely phase-based modulators.  Finally, Chapter 5 describes work on chip-scale optical phased arrays and a method for achieving half-wavelength emitter waveguide pitch."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:52Z (GMT).

Putnam, David A.||Estroff, Lara A.	2018-10-03T18:42:11Z			12/30/17		"Despite advances in nanomaterials synthesis, the bottom-up preparation of nanopatterned films as templates for spatially confined surface reactions and nucleation of crystalline inorganics remains a challenge. I developed an approach to fabricating nanoscale thin film surface structures with periodicities on the order of 20 to 50 nm and with the capacity to localize reactions with small molecules and nanoparticles. A block copolymer (BCP) of polystyrene-block-poly[(allyl glycidyl ether)-co-(ethylene oxide)] (PS-b-P(AGE-co-EO)) is used to prepare periodically-ordered, reactive thin films. As proof-of-principle demonstrations of the versatility of the chemical functionalization, a small organic molecule, an amino acid, and ultrasmall silica nanoparticles are selectively attached via thiol-ene click chemistry to the exposed P(AGE-co-EO) domains of the BCP thin film. My approach employing click chemistry on the spatially confined reactive surfaces of a BCP thin film overcomes the solvent incompatibilities typically encountered when synthetic polymers are functionalized with water-soluble molecules. Moreover, this post-assembly functionalization of a reactive thin film surface preserves the original patterning, reduces the amount of required reactant, and leads to short reaction times. 
The small molecule functionalized area can subsequently template the confined crystallization of copper (I) oxide (Cu2O) and zinc oxide (ZnO) with high fidelity, from aqueous solutions at low temperatures (below 60 ¬∞C) with periodicities on the order of 50 nm. The demonstrated method provides a versatile materials platform to control the growth of nanostructured crystalline materials via the introduction of a plethora of surface functional groups. The resulting organic substrates can be used to template the growth and control the crystal orientation and texturing of multiple different crystalline inorganic materials on surfaces nanostructured via BCP self-assembly. The demonstrated approach is expected to provide a new materials platform in applications including sensing, catalysis, pattern recognition, or microelectronics."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:42:11Z (GMT).

In combination with high energy density metal anodes, metal/O2 batteries provide exceptional energy density capacity. By properly selecting a catalytic electrolyte for the cell and exploiting the nucleophilic properties of the superoxide, we demonstrate the ability to deploy the system for energy production and low-value chemicals upgrade/conversion.
The examined Al/O2 electrochemical system uses Al as the anode and an imidazolium-based ionic liquid/AlCl3 salt electrolyte. Compared to other high energy density metals, Al is more abundant, inherently safer to handle and has higher volumetric capacity. The selected electrolyte has been shown to complex with thermodynamically stable chemicals and catalyze their conversion.
Herein we report an Al/O2+CO2 electrochemical cell with the ability to capture and convert CO2 to useful C2 species, oxalate, while enhancing the discharge capacity of the cell.

Stroock, Abraham Duncan||Dando, Robin	2018-10-22T17:23:54Z			5/30/18		Transport of a taste stimulus from a beverage to the taste pores was computationally modeled in different anatomy scales: tongue's anterodorsal surface, circumvallate papillae and whole oral cavity in three dimensions. The models are based on the fundamental governing equations of transport phenomena. The stimulus delivery details were based on the experiments in literature or the sensory experiments run by the author. The fluid flow and stimulus transport were simulated based on the details of each anatomy. Realistic topology of a tongue‚Äôs surface, including lingual papilla histology, and the realistic anatomy of the oral cavity of a human subject were considered. For anterior surface of the tongue, results show that the uneven surface of the tongue has considerable influence on the persistence of supra-threshold stimulus concentration near taste pores. Time-concentration profiles were developed for various locations along the tongue‚Äôs surface. These profiles showed strong association with measured time-intensity (TI) profiles from literature, specifically, the rising phase, total duration and slopes. The computed concentration profiles can be used to better understand the course of events occurring during taste stimulation, which in turn will provide a better understanding of the relationship between a stimulus bulk concentration and its perceived intensity. For circumvallate papilla, the histological details such as secretion from von-Ebner gland into the cleft and a thin layer of saliva covering the papilla are included in the model. The experimental results show a relatively long intensity reaction time. The time-concentration profile of the tastant within the cleft shows that the secretion from von-Ebner gland contributes to the longer reaction time. Also, the comparison between the intensity and concentration profiles suggests that adaptation to taste takes place despite rising concentrations near taste buds.  For the model on the whole oral cavity, the results show that the time-concentration profile near tongue is different than the time-concentration profile introduced upon stimulus delivery. Also, the computed concentration is studied against the intensity recorded under the same conditions. The results show a close association between the time-concentration profile near the tongue's surface and the time-intensity profile. The framework upon which the model is developed can be used for various consumption conditions, contributing to a quantitative understating of the relation between tastant concentration and taste intensity.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:54Z (GMT).

F. verticillioides causes the disease Fusarium ear rot (FER) and produces the toxic fungal secondary metabolite (mycotoxin) fumonisin, which can reduce yields and marketability of maize grain. More importantly, fumonisin exposure is associated with health risks for humans and animals. This dissertation aimed to dissect the genetics and mechanisms conferring resistance to FER and fumonisin contamination in maize. Employing point and inundative F. verticillioides inoculation methods with a panel of 50 maize inbred lines, the symptomatology of F. verticillioides infection (FVI) was dissected, showing that kernel bulk density is an accurate predictor of fumonisin contamination in maize kernels. Quantitative trait locus mapping and correlation analyses further demonstrated the link between kernel bulk density and resistance to FVI and revealed the diverse modes of pathogenesis and resistance loci present in four tropical-by-temperate recombinant inbred line maize families. Inter-trait correlation analyses, genome-wide association mapping, and genomic prediction of 29 publicly available disease resistance (including FER) and morphophysiological traits on the maize core diversity panel revealed that height and inflorescence traits were associated and shared loci disease resistance.

Unfortunately, these covalent cross-links preclude the reshaping or reprocessing these materials, which limits both the technological applications and sustainable use of these materials. Recent efforts have focused on the incorporation of dynamic covalent bonds into cross-linked materials to enable their continuous reprocessing (Chapter 1). We have focused on applying these strategies to cross-linked polyurethane networks, since these are the most prevalent class of cross-linked polymers. We first demonstrated that the synthesis of cross-linked polyhydroxyurethanes (PHUs) generates cross-linked resins that are inherently reprocessable, likely through mechanically-activated transcarbamoylation reactions that occur at elevated temperature (Chapter 2). We further studied how the polymer structure affects the thermal stability and reprocessability of PHUs (Chapter 3). Due to the slow and incomplete reprocessing observed in these systems, we incorporated more dynamic disulfide bonds into PHU networks as one strategy to enable rapid, quantitative reprocessing of these materials (Chapter 4). Through our many studies on the reprocessing of these and related materials, we have discovered that cross-linked polyurethane resins are inherently dynamic under mild conditions in the presence of certain catalysts, and we demonstrate the potential to use this finding to reprocess PUs traditionally considered to be thermoset materials (Chapter 5).		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:55Z (GMT).

Expansions of non-native earthworms and native white-tailed deer populations have occurred simultaneous with other stressors, but conservation and management mandates are focused on individual threats. Here, we provide a mechanistic explanation of the individual and combined effects of deer and earthworms on forest understory plant species using experimental plantings in a 2 x 2 factorial design. We seek to understand what makes many species decline under these altered forest conditions, and to test the viability of restoring plant communities. First, we assessed earthworm impacts on cycling of a broad spectrum of nutrients. We found earthworms are associated with lower soil P, but higher concentrations of other nutrients in the A horizon, including Ca, Mg, K and S. Despite this, we saw little rooting in the A horizon of earthworm invaded plots. This could be due to the stressful rooting conditions in the surface soil of the A horizon created by earthworm activity. If non-native plants that have coevolved with earthworms are able to access these nutrient-rich pools that are largely untapped by the background native vegetation, they may proliferate in earthworm-invaded forests. Of the native species were assessed, successful species were able to incorporate additional Ca into their tissues, and maintained consistent tissue P despite earthworm-associated depletions in soil. Species that declined could not capitalize on higher soil Ca in earthworm invaded plots, and had lower concentrations of P in roots and leaves. For the next two studies, we used transplant experiments of species with a breadth of growth forms to standardize species pools. We explored indirect methods of deer and earthworm impact on fine roots, mycorrhizal associations and soil nutrients. We found earthworms and/or deer decreased % colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in one species (Quercus) but not others, negatively affected soil nutrient concentrations and pools and increased or decreased the proportion of fine roots relative to total root length. However, this did not reliably translate to changes in seedling survival or biomass. Finally, we followed transplants of 20 native understory species over four to six years. Initially, seedlings of most species had poorer establishment in earthworm invaded plots, but by the end of the experiment, earthworms benefited 13 of 20 species and negatively affected five. Earthworm impacts on seedling survival was largely decoupled from impacts on growth and reproduction, with most species performing better in earthworm-invaded plots. Deer limited most species‚Äô growth, reproduction, and (to a lesser degree) survival, including tall, non- palatable species. Survival of species with high foliar nitrogen concentrations were slightly diminished in the presence of both deer and earthworms. Despite lower survival of some species in earthworm-invaded plots, we were successful in establishing shade-intolerant species into forests. This suggests that after initial changes to the forest floor from earthworm invasion have stabilized, restoration of the vegetation can be successful if it is paired with deer management.

However, like many large gene families, there are many inherent difficulties in understanding both the individual roles, and evolutionary history of MYB TFs. Individually, it may be difficult to isolate the functions of a given MYB TF, as there are numerous similar TFs serving related or overlapping functions. As a group, the similarities between members of a gene family can make it difficult to disentangle the forces causing their propagation and maintenance. There are many essential pathways governed by TFs that have evolved via massive expansions, such that a high degree of similarity and redundancy occurs within the gene family. This thesis is concerned with confronting this complex issue, attempting to learn as much as possible about the history and patterns found within the MYB TF family. The objectives of this research are to examine the results of screens involving MYB TF binding partners, and to apply new tools and methods to MYB genes to learn about their evolutionary history. Based on the meta-analysis of biological screens and the use of phylogenetic and recombination detection techniques, this research proposes mechanisms to explain patterns observed and improve the predictive power of computational approaches.

Due to their atomic thinness, flexibility, and versatile electrical properties (i.e. conductors, semiconductors, and insulators), we can envision future ultra-small, flexible computers completely comprised of various two-dimensional materials. For this application, lateral heterostructures of two-dimensional materials play a major role in the realization of wholly two- dimensional devices, as they are the fundamental elements in a circuit, such as p-n junctions and metal-semiconductor contacts. This dissertation will employ transmission electron microscopy and related techniques to address how different two-dimensional materials merge to form lateral heterostructures, specifically between two distinct two-dimensional semiconductors (analogous to p-n junctions) and two-dimensional conductor- semiconductor heterostructures (analogous to metal-semiconductor contacts). Within the heterostructures between two semiconductors, Chapter 2 and 3 will discuss atomically sharp interfaces and gradual interfaces in lateral heterostructures, respectively. Chapter 4 will describe the conductor-semiconductor interconnects between two-dimensional materials with dissimilar lattice structures. Our results demonstrate how the strain is relaxed in epitaxial lateral heterostructures, as well as how the heterostructure between crystallographically distinct two-dimensional materials forms. These findings can unravel how to use or engineer distortions in two-dimensional lateral heterojunctions, predict the mechanical strength and devices performance, and inform the mechanism of chemical synthesis at the interface between atomically thin films.		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:56Z (GMT).

The compiler is one of the key components that convert the goal structure into a directed map which an arbitrary number of robots can follow to perform decentralized construction. In previous work, the compiler was limited to brute force search which scales poorly with the size of structure. The purpose of this research is to enhance the scalability of the compiler so that it can be applied to very large-scale structures. Correspondingly, a new scalable compiler is presented, with the ability to generate directed maps for structures with up to 1 million stack of bricks. We further recast the old compiler as a constraint satisfaction problem and compare their performance on a range of structures. Results show that the new compiler has significant advantages over the old compiler as the size and complexity of the structures increase. We further developed an automated scheme for improving the transition probability between neighboring stack of bricks for efficient construction. This work represents an important step towards real-world deployment of robot collectives for construction.		6/8/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:57Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

From the postwar years through the 1960s, U.S. freeway plans catalyzed a public reckoning regarding the natures of cities. Government officials, urban dwellers, and designers and planners across the United States debated the infrastructures‚Äô placement, wrangling over the values of threatened sites and neighborhoods. Through these debates, prior conceptions of urban environments expanded to encompass the dynamic, living, and inter-relational dimensions of cities. This transformation took place via public discourse, and also through innovative design approaches, as architects, landscape architects, and urban designers engaged freeway designs as opportunities for technical and methodological experimentation. Mixing earlier generations‚Äô parkway visions and concerns for spatial experience with emergent cybernetic themes, data-driven analysis, scientific references, and anticipations of computerization, these explorative designs modeled natural forces in new ways, and at new scales.
The following chapters examine freeway projects by Lawrence Halprin, Kevin Lynch, Donald Appleyard, Christopher Alexander, Ian McHarg, and others, drawing on frameworks from environmental history and science and technology studies to interrogate how freeway design processes engaged public controversies and modeled human/nature relationships. The chapters advance in time and scale, showing how conceptualizations of the urban environment shifted with changes in drawing implements, uses of eyes and hands, inclusion and exclusion of data, and designers‚Äô understandings of their roles relative to living forces. The resulting fine-grained account charts how urban infrastructures, environmental ideas, and design practices evolved together from the mid 1950s through the late 1960s: tracking the evolution of urban environmentalism, elucidating sensorial aspects of freeways, and scrutinizing the political advantages and cultural complications of visualizing landscapes through data-based quantification.
This text makes designers‚Äô roles in environmental movements more accessible to a broad range of scholars. It contributes to an emerging transdisciplinary discourse regarding environmental histories of design, and forges new ground at the intersection of literatures on ecological design, architectural drawing and making, urban environmental history, and science and technology studies. Above all, it articulates what is at stake ‚Äì socially, politically, and environmentally ‚Äì in how designers engage the many skilled actions of designing."

Seventeen years prior to the 79 CE eruption that sealed the city, Pompeian citizens experienced an earthquake that disrupted the city‚Äôs water system. Over the course of the city‚Äôs remaining years, its people attempted to return the city to its former standards, including renovating public and private water systems and restoring the d√©cor of their homes. Were fountain paintings created when actual fountains could not be used? Using chi-square analysis to calculate the relationship between variables, the results indicates there is no statistically significant relationship between painted fountains and private water access. Instead, painted fountains represent a realistic representation of gardens as a psychological mechanism to bring order to the chaotic natural world in the aftermath of the earthquake.

In response to host defenses, most plant viruses have evolved mechanisms to interfere with sRNA biogenesis and activity, with broad effects on host homeostasis. This thesis includes studies on virus and viroid detection by searching for pathogen-specific nucleic acids and pathogen-derived sRNA products of the host defense machinery.  Two short reports describe the detection of Spinach latent virus and Australian grapevine viroid.  A third study describes the limited genetic diversity of Grapevine virus E infecting grapevines across the US. In a subsequent study, a combination of electron microscopy and next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies were used to elucidate the identity and complete genome sequence of another grapevine infecting virus, namely Grapevine asteroid mosaic associated virus; obtaining a full genome sequence allowed an examination and comparison of the genome‚Äôs functional domains and sequence signatures that reflect strategies for the expression and processing of the virus encoded proteins. Finally, to better understand the role of sRNAs in the regulation of gene expression, a genome wide evaluation was performed of the biogenesis and activity of two kinds of sRNAs, microRNAs and phased interfering small interfering RNAs. Using a combination of multiple types of NGS datasets and the design of a custom bioinformatics pipeline, a broad scale sRNA-mediated regulatory network was described. Evaluation of the network‚Äôs regulatory contribution indicated that sRNA-mediated regulation plays a major role in gene expression. A large proportion of genes in Arabidopsis thaliana were found to be controlled by sRNAs, including genes involved in most biological processes. Finally, the role of sRNAs as key regulators was further confirmed by the extended number of genes under sRNA control that are involved in others aspects of regulation, in particular transcription factors.

Poveda, Katja Andrea||Ryan, Matthew R.	2018-10-22T17:23:58Z			5/30/18		Agroecological theory suggests that environmental impacts of agriculture can be reduced while maintaining yields by increasing diversity in agroecosystems.  This increased diversity may support enhanced ecosystem services, reducing the need for inputs such as pesticides and fertilizers. Agricultural researchers have begun to test in agroecosystems what is already well established in unmanaged ecosystems; that more diverse communities, especially those with greater functional trait diversity, are more productive and tend to be higher functioning. Using data collected in the field of cover crop mixtures and a meta-analysis approach, I set out to test the effect of different levels of diversity (intraspecific, interspecific, and functional group), on a set of ecosystem services such as yield, weed suppression, and nitrogen fixation among others. Additionally, I attempted to evaluate the effect of environment on the relationship between diversity and ecosystem service performance, again using multiple methods including a mother-daughter design on working farms.  The meta-analysis of cultivar mixtures showed an overall 2.2% relative yield benefit in food crops, however increased intraspecific diversity had only a minimal effect in cover crop mixtures in the two year field experiment at the research farm or on farms. There was a significant reduction in weed biomass in cultivar mixtures overall. Ultimately, there was no negative impact on any ecosystem service. Cover crop mixtures of multiple species, especially those with both grass and legume functional groups, often had better biomass production compared to monocultures. The grass/legume mixtures buffered the effects of soil nitrogen fertility much better than either functional group alone for some services. In both the meta-analysis and field trials, more stressful environmental conditions tended to accentuate the diversity effect. In other words, the benefit of more diverse communities was greater in higher stress environments, lending some support to the stress-gradient hypothesis. The on-farm results showed that while functional group mixtures were always as good as or better than monocultures, the precise relationship between these different levels of diversity for the different services varied depending on the location. Overall, my results indicate benefits from all levels of diversity, with more functionally diverse mixtures delivering greater ecosystem service performance, especially in higher stress environments.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:58Z (GMT).

In this dissertation, I explore several hydrodynamical processes in accretion disks, primarily using numerical hydrodynamics simulations. I study the effect of viscosity on unstable oscillation modes in disks around black holes, showing that it can either suppress or enhance instability. I study the effect of a vortex instability that may arise at the edges of dead zones in protoplanetary disks, showing that it can transport angular momentum through the disk, as well as trap dust, with the latter process resulting in observable morphological features. I investigate the resonant truncation of disks in binaries when they are misaligned with the binary orbital plane, showing that misaligned disks around stars with companions are larger than aligned disks, and that misaligned circumbinary disks generally have smaller cavities than aligned disks. I undertake a comprehensive investigation of the dynamics and evolution of circumbinary disks, with a particular emphasis on the transfer of angular momentum between the disk and binary. I find that circumbinary disks may cause binaries to expand, contrary to the typical expectation that disks tend to harden binaries. Finally, I investigate the migration of a low-mass planets near the inner edge of protoplanetary disk, and show that interactions with the inner edge halt the migration of the planet when its orbital radius is several times larger than the inner disk radius.

The essential nutrient choline may mitigate some of these impairments, as suggested by data in humans and trophoblast cell culture. Choline is a precursor for several molecules with crucial roles during pregnancy: the methyl donor betaine, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and the phospholipid phosphatidylcholine. Through betaine, it participates in the metabolic network referred to as one-carbon metabolism which is essential for many biochemical processes including nucleotide synthesis, DNA methylation, and amino acid metabolism. Demand for one-carbon (methyl) nutrients, including choline, folate, and vitamin B-12, is high during pregnancy when cells of the placenta and fetus undergo rapid division. This dissertation research sought to examine the effects of choline supplementation during pregnancy in the Dlx3+/- mouse, a model of placental insufficiency.
Study 1 investigated the effects of maternal choline supplementation (MCS) on pregnancy outcomes in Dlx3+/- mice. This study demonstrated that maternal choline supplementation led to a marked increase in fetal growth by mid-gestation, which resulted in compensatory mechanisms to slow growth by downregulating Igf1. Placental betaine concentrations were strongly predictive of fetal weights, suggesting betaine supply may be a determinant of fetal growth.
Study 2 explored the effects of MCS on aspects of placental function in the Dlx3+/- mouse. The main findings indicate that a higher maternal choline intake can alter placental labyrinth size, modulate expression of angiogenic and inflammatory genes in the placenta, and decrease placental apoptosis; and that these effects occur in a fetal sex-dependent manner.
Study 3 assessed the effects of MCS on vitamin B-12 status in mice with and without placental insufficiency. In addition, data from a human feeding study was used to further explore this relationship. MCS increased the active form of vitamin B-12 in pregnant women; genetic variants that increase choline requirements were also shown to alter vitamin B-12 markers. 
Taken together, these studies suggest that higher levels of choline intake during pregnancy may be beneficial for the mother and fetus, and provide support for further research on the use of choline for improving placental function and mitigating placental insufficiency."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:42:13Z (GMT).

Figuring out an efficient method to dynamically forecast the hurricane evacuation demand with high accuracy plays a crucial role in preparedness work of hurricane management.  Recently, substantial studies and research exit on understanding hurricane evacuation behavior. However, in this thesis, some forecast covariates which were not mentioned before, are introduced into the prediction of hurricane evacuation rate. Moreover, two travel demand models are applied in this study: A Sequential Logit Model and a Cox proportional hazards model. These two models are used for estimating the probability of each household to evacuate in the specific time step. After applying the data from Hurricane Gustav (2008) in Louisiana, over 76% households‚Äô dynamic evacuation behavior are predicted correctly.

The need to dramatically scale this platform for communications applications has led to active research in switching and multiplexing signals using different degrees-of-freedom of light such as path, wavelength, and the transverse spatial mode. In recent years, extending the platform to use new materials has allowed for a new range of applications such as quantum optics, biosensing, and spectroscopy that span the visible to mid-infrared wavelength range. Fully utilizing this platform allows an unparalleled level of control over a large set of optical channels in waveguides with reconfiguration capability, low power consumption, and more stability which can be applied to this broad range of applications. This allows large table-top optical setups for quantum optics and microscopy to be miniaturized to the compact footprint of a nanophotonics chip.
Here in this dissertation, we extend this multiplexing nanophotonic platform into the visible wavelength regime in order to address two areas that require high density optical channels: quantum optics and neural interfaces for optogenetics. We develop a platform based on low-loss silicon nitride waveguides that can be thermally tuned using integrated microheaters to introduce reconfigurability in the visible wavelength range. We show how nanophotonic optical channels can be used for both quantum interference as well as neuron activation within the brain.
To scale up the integrated quantum optics platform, we developed nanophotonics building blocks that utilize the transverse spatial modes within a single multimode waveguide for key quantum interference experiments that form the basis of more complex transformations within a smaller footprint. We used the transverse spatial degree-of-freedom because it can be controlled by simple geometric design, relieves the burden on the light source, and does not require non-standard materials, long delay lines, and high speed electronics, which is the case for time and frequency encoding.  The high confinement of the silicon nitride allows for well separated modes that can be accessed by using geometry controlled selective phase matching. We demonstrated quantum interference using the higher order modes within a single multimode waveguide. We demonstrated both passive and active tuning of the interference between different modes while maintaining high visibility interference in the quantum regime.
To address the reconfiguration and resolution limitations of current optogenetic neural studies, we developed an implantable neural probe with an embedded reconfigurable nanophotonic switching network for creating high resolution spatiotemporal optical patterns. We use the same silicon nitride platform redesigned for the blue wavelength range. Using full phase control within a path interferometer network, we demonstrated a fully reconfigurable 1x8 switch that can control an array of microbeams to excite single neurons on a 20 microsecond timescale, much faster than neuron response times. We developed packaging techniques for the implantable nanophotonic chip for in vivo studies. We show for the first time precisely defined and repeatable neural spike patterns in vivo with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Finally, we discuss how this platform can be extended for large-scale neural studies."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:55Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Beginning with a unique typology for detecting abusive language, we outline the distinctions and similarities of different abusive language subtasks (offensive language, hate speech, cyberbullying and trolling) and how we might benefit from the progress made in each area. Specifically, we suggest that each subtask can be categorized based on whether or not the abusive language being studied 1) is directed at a specific individual, or targets a generalized ``Other" and 2) the extent to which the language is explicit versus implicit. We then use knowledge gained from this typology to tackle the ``problem of offensive language" in hate speech detection. A key challenge for automated hate speech detection on social media is the separation of hate speech from other instances of offensive language. We present a Logistic Regression classifier, trained on human annotated Twitter data, that makes use of a uniquely derived lexicon of hate terms along with features that have proven successful in the detection of offensive language, hate speech and cyberbullying. Using the tweets classified by the aforementioned hate speech classifier, we extract a set of users for which we collect demographic and psychological attributes, with the goal of understanding how these attributes are related to hate speech use. We first present a binary Random Forest classifier for predicting whether or not a Twitter user is a hate speaker. We then explore the use of linear and Random Forest regression models as a means of explaining and predicting levels of hate speech use based on user attributes. To the best of my knowledge, this work is the first to present an automated approach for detecting individual hate speakers. Finally, we present a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for identifying polarized groups using tripartite graphs (user-post-tag) gleaned from social media data. This work is heavily inspired by the need for an unsupervised approach that works well in contexts varying in the nature of the controversy, the level of polarization, the number of polarity groups involved, and the presence of neutral entities.  I present the first ever analysis of polarization on data from the Tumblr platform, showing improved performance over traditional community detection methods and the state-of-the-art method of NMF on bipartite graphs.

Through the lens of machine learning and machine vision, this thesis focuses on approaches of learning representations of web-scale data in perspectives of web user interaction and web content comprehension.
This thesis work contributes to the field of machine learning in both algorithmic foundations and practical advances. The first part focuses on classification and prediction problems on the web when the interactions of individuals are modeled by graphs. We will leverage graphs and machine learning models as tools to effectively represent how users' interactions are related to each other, and to identify interesting patterns of behavior of web users. The second part of the thesis focuses on methods for  understanding and comprehending visual contents on the web. In particular, we turn to deep learning -- a subfield of machine learning that has recently been placed at the core of many web-driven tasks such as image classification and understanding. Despite its success, there has been lacking understanding of the representations learned by deep neural networks. This thesis sheds light on how we can be better interpret the inner representations of deep neural networks, and also leads to new techniques of how we can facilitate learning better representations."

With the rapid development of hardware and novel experimental techniques, there is an increasing demand for advanced algorithms to work with new experimental data or improve existing techniques. In this dissertation, we investigate a variety of image reconstruction algorithms for tomography and ptychography - two fast growing areas in electron microscopy. Using experimental and simulated data, we examine the limitations of advanced reconstruction algorithms and propose new methods to improve existing methods. Chapter 1 provides an overview of transmission electron microscopy and introduces some basic concepts in imaging science. Chapter 2 takes a more in-depth discussion of elastic scattering in STEM and how beam propagation can be described analytically and computationally. The next two chapters focus on electron tomography, a technique that reconstructs the 3D structure of the object. Chapter 3 describes the experimental setup and demonstrates an efficient Fourier-based reconstruction framework that works well with novel experimental techniques, including dual-axis tomography and through-focal tomography. In Chapter 4, we investigate the popular sparsity-exploiting reconstruction algorithms - exploring their practical limitations in the context of electron tomography. Chapter 5 introduces electron ptychography, a diffractive imaging technique that is enabled by the recent development of a high dynamic range detector. Here we demonstrate a full-field ptychographic reconstruction that doubles the spatial resolution of the traditional lens limitations. Finally, in Chapter 6 we further study the practical limitations of ptychography and propose new strategies for reconstructions.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:23:59Z (GMT).

While some research has investigated the public‚Äôs reaction to various management practices, few have focused on intensive habitat management contexts. Individuals‚Äô reactions to the use of active management practices have serious implications for nature preserves as the public‚Äôs discontent with active management has previously delayed or impeded restoration work that led to a decline in ecosystem health. This thesis aims to explore how the use of active management practices influences individuals‚Äô affective response to the managed landscape, level of attachment to the preserve, and intention to perform place-protective behaviors. Additionally, we quantitively examine the influence of other factors (i.e. knowledge, attitudes, perceived risk, responsibility, and identity) on individuals‚Äô intention to perform place-protective behaviors.

This species spends most of its two-year life cycle either questing for hosts on leaf litter and low-lying vegetation, or inactive during non-questing periods in the soil. Despite the prolonged periods this species spends off-host, the effects of the biotic and abiotic components of the soil ecosystem on the mortality of I. scapularis is not well-characterized. I began by exploring the effect of hot, dry weather conditions on Lyme disease incidences in geographic areas with differing endemic histories. In long-term endemic areas the incidence of Lyme disease was significantly lower during hot and dry weather, while in areas that have become endemic for Lyme disease more recently, there was a strong positive linear relationship between time and incidence. Similarly, I demonstrated that hot, dry weather conditions negatively affected the activity of questing I. scapularis. Next, I evaluated the efficacy of using microcosms to deploy and recover ticks from the field. This technique allowed me to exclude host-related factors and investigate the direct effects of local-scale site factors on tick survival. These microcosms were used to investigate the effect of weather on overwintering I. scapularis nymphs, and also determine the effect of soil-dwelling arthropod predators on the survival of engorged larval and nymphal I. scapularis. The timing of I. scapularis mortality events during their overwintering period (September ‚Äì June) was determined by placing ticks in field microcosms and collecting subsets of the microcosms every 50 days throughout this period. Lipid storage levels were also quantified to determine the body condition of all the ticks that were retrieved from the field. Nymphal I. scapularis experienced limited mortality over the winter, with the majority perishing in the spring and early summer. Survival during this period was also positively correlated with tick body condition (i.e. lipid storage). Additionally, these data were compared with those from a previous season during which the weather was relatively cold and wet. Tick survival and energy storage were found to be significantly higher during the cold and wet year, but further investigation was needed as these data were collected on different sites. To further explore the effect of winter weather, snow cover was manipulated over microcosms containing I. scapularis nymphs. At the end of the season snow removal was found to have no effect on overwinter tick survival, but there was a negative relationship between tick survival and the number of large arthropod predators in the microcosms. The prevalence of soil-dwelling arthropod predators which would target I. scapularis nymphs and engorged larvae was investigated, both in the laboratory and under field conditions. Overall, it was observed that few species of arthropod predator targeted I. scapularis, but those which did showed a preference for engorged larvae over unfed nymphs. An important exception was Schizocosa ocreata, a common species of wolf spider, which was found to target I. scapularis in the laboratory, and significantly reduced tick survival when added to microcosms under field conditions. I concluded by outlining the future research necessary to further investigate the impact of the soil environment on tick activity and behavior, with the goal of determining the factors driving the high degree of observed spatio-temporal variability present in many tick borne-disease systems.

Currently, low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used to photograph and map large areas at centimeter-scale resolution, and already are starting to be used by vector control personnel to efficiently locate mosquito habitat. However, post-processing of UAV images is still time intensive, often done manually, or with programs built for satellite imagery. Moreover, UAVs have never previously been used to assess habitat suitability in the more populated areas preferred by Aedes albopictus, a species that breeds primarily in standing water in artificial containers near human populations. This work explored the use of UAVs and convolutional neural for integrated mosquito management. 
Two neighborhoods comprising 125 houses in a densely-populated area of southern New York, were surveyed over nine days in 2017 with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV survey coincided with an entomological survey, which was conducted on a subset of the houses to establish the presence and distribution of mosquito species. 64% the of 629 containers surveyed on all properties could be seen from the UAV, with almost 2,000 more features were identified the images (e.g. from houses that were not surveyed). In total, more than 2500 objects of interest (containers suitable mosquito habitat or related features) were identified in the aerial photographs. Two previously-published neural network architectures were trained on this novel set of UAV¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨ aerial imagery. Single Shot Multibox Detection was used for image segmentation, achieving an average precision of 59%, a recall of 35%, and an overall accuracy of 31%. Separately, a fully convolutional neural net based on the VGG16 architecture, initiated with ImageNet weights and finetuned on images of surveyed properties assigned as positive or negative for Ae. albopictus larvae, achieved a binary classification of 80%.
When combined with image segmentation neural networks, unmanned aerial vehicles show promise for identifying potential habitat for Ae. albopictus, increasing the ability of vector control personnel to manage mosquito populat¬¨¬¨ions. The neural networks‚Äô abilities to predict larval presence could be further advanced by expanding training datasets, especially where containers of interest may vary by neighborhood."

Of the many factors, the tissue microenvironment is increasingly appreciated for its crucial role in tumor initiation, progression, recurrence, and treatment response. The microvasculature is a critical determinant of tissue perfusion, with important consequences for cellular metabolism, drug delivery, and metastasis. To better understand how tissue perfusion contributes to tumor malignancy, I fabricated microphysiological in vitro models of the tumor-vascular microenvironment and assessed the differential regulation of tumor hypoxia response in 2D versus 3D culture. Results from these studies point to the value of tissue engineering approaches for deciphering the interdependence between cancer cells and their vascular microenvironment. 
Laboratory-based research provides important insights on the biological mechanisms of disease, and these basic sciences approaches are strengthened by a broad understanding of the human and social dimensions of cancer. To this end, I helped initiate and sustain a community-based partnership that fosters dialogue between cancer patients and scientists. The partnership enables the mutual exchange of knowledge and experience across the community-campus boundary. This project led to several major outcomes, including a monthly seminar for non-academic audiences, a certificate program for public engagement, an undergraduate writing class about cancer, and several avenues for informal science education. The patient-researcher partnership has a sustained impact in graduate and postdoctoral training at Cornell and provides a valuable forum to our local cancer community."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:42:16Z (GMT).

On one hand, we investigate a method of kinematic reconstruction suited for events containing top quarks produced in conjunction with other particles. After optimising the fitting process, we apply the reconstruction to ttH, H to bb events in the single-leptonic channel. The reconstruction results in better estimates of particle momenta (including neutrino momenta) when applied to simulated events where the correct b quark permutations are known. However, when applied to fully-simulated MC datasets, it produces little change in the limits on the ttH signal strength calculated using BDTs pre-trained on non-reconstructed events. In parallel, we study techniques for effective science communication for different audiences. In particular, we focus on my blog about the science of music and speech, which uses narrative elements, self-coded multimedia demos, and explanations at various levels of detail to present the subject in an appealing and understandable way. Finally, we briefly look at communication techniques for guided tours at CERN for the visiting public.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:00Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

It can be helpful for preventing false signals in genetic association studies and finding relatives in forensic genetics. However, relatedness among samples is not always obtained when collecting sample data; in most cases, the relatedness is unknown and needs to be determined. Here, we develop an algorithm to infer relatedness among samples that we aim to be more efficient than current related approaches such as PLINK. Our approach is based on finding stretches of shared alleles across windows of moderate length (3-5 centiMorgans) in the genome. With this information, the algorithm infers the degree of relatedness up to the third degree from the number of windows that are similar between a pair of individuals.

The GBM‚Äìgrape complex represents an excellent system to explore the chemically-mediated mechanisms of host plant location because the GBM is an ovipositional specialist, meaning gravid females discriminate between host and non-host plants.  Additionally, synthetic blends of host plant volatiles have already been shown to attract GBM females in the flight tunnel (Cha et al. 2008).  Therefore the GBM-grape complex was used to test the existing theories regarding host plant location.  I used flight tunnel assays to observe GBM responses to host and non-host odor sources (cut shoots, extracts, and synthetic blends), and isolate and identify the volatiles that elicit the observed behavior.  All antennally active compounds found in grape shoots were also present in non-host plants.  Moths displayed higher levels of upwind flight than expected to non-host sources, suggesting discrimination is not occurring at a distance.  I used additional flight tunnel assays, to investigate cues necessary to elicit landing on an odor source (water vapor and visual cues). Individual and paired stimuli did not elicit landing, and landing only occurred when plant volatiles, a visual cue, and water vapor were all present, suggesting the cues have a synergistic effect.  Interestingly, moths flew upwind a low percentage of the time in response to water vapor alone suggesting the moths can use nonspecific cues to locate a host.  In a final study, I explored whether microorganisms living on the surface of plant shoots produced the behaviorally active compounds. Volatile collections of surface sterilized plant shoots indicated the surface microorganisms did not significantly contribute to the volatile profile of the grape shoots as all of the peaks in the volatile profile of sanitized shoots were found in the profile of control shoots. In flight tunnel assays, moths responded similarly to sanitized shoots as they did to control shoots suggesting surface microorganisms did not play a significant role in the production of previously identified blend of behaviorally active volatiles.

Transforming unsupervised problems of learning low-dimensional geometry into provable decompositions of co-occurrence information, spectral inference provides fast algorithms and optimality guarantees for non-linear dimensionality reduction or latent topic analysis. Spectral approaches reduce the dependence on the original training examples and produce substantial gain in efficiency, but at costs: a) The algorithms perform poorly on real data that does not necessarily follow underlying models; b) Users can no longer infer information about individual examples, which is often important for real-world applications; c) Model complexity rapidly grows as the number of objects increases, requiring a careful curation of the vocabulary. The first issue is called model-data mismatch, which is a fundamental problem common in every spectral inference method for latent variable models. As real data never follows any particular computational model, this issue must be ad- dressed for practicality of the spectral inference beyond synthetic settings. For the second issue, users could revisit probabilistic inference to infer information about individual examples, but this brings back all the drawbacks of traditional approaches. One method is recently developed for spectral inference, but it works only on tiny models, quickly losing its performance for the datasets whose underlying structures exhibit realistic correlations. While probabilistic inference also suffers from the third issue, the problem is more serious for spectral inferences because co-occurrence information easily exceeds storable capacity as the size of vocabulary becomes larger. We cast the learning problem in the framework of Joint Stochastic Matrix Factorization (JSMF), showing that existing methods violate the theoretical conditions necessary for a good solution to exist. Proposing novel rectification paradigms for handling the model-data mismatch, the Rectified Anchor Word Algorithm (RAWA) is able to learn quality latent structures and their interactions even on small noisy data. We also propose the Prior Aware Dual Decomposition (PADD) that is capable of considering the learned interactions as well as the learned latent structures to robustly infer example- specific information. Beyond the theoretical guarantees, our experimental results show that RAWA recovers quality low-dimensional geometry on various textual/non-textual datasets comparable to probabilistic Gibbs sampling, and PADD substantially outperforms the recently developed method for learning low-dimensional representations of individual examples. Although this thesis does not address the complexity issue for large vocabulary, we have developed new methods that can drastically compress co-occurrence information and learn only with the compressed statistics without losing much precision. Providing rich capability to operate on millions of objects and billions of examples, we complete all the necessary tools to make spectral inference robust and scalable competitor to probabilistic inference for unsupervised latent structure learning. We hope our research serves an initial basis for a new perspective that combines the benefits of both spectral and probabilistic worlds.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:02Z (GMT).

Mezey, Jason G.||Pawlowski, Wojciech||Richards, Eric Jean	2018-10-22T17:24:02Z			5/30/18		To assess the impact of regulatory variation on a genomic scale, a large scale gene expression resource was created from seven tissues profiled using 3‚Äô RNAseq in a diverse set of nearly 300 maize lines. This resource enabled testing associations between multiple levels of biological organization from genotype to intermediate phenotype to terminal phenotypes including yield. Specifically, associations were tested between genotypes and gene expression (eQTL) and between gene expression and downstream phenotypes. This large-scale expression resource was used to quantify the impact of rare allele abundance on expression and to assess the relationship between dysregulation of expression and terminal fitness phenotypes. Expression extremes were found to be strongly associated with local rare allele abundance. Additionally, formerly rare alleles whose frequencies increased as a result of the tropical-temperate bottleneck were found to have an outsize impact on expression in predominantly temperate germplasm. Furthermore, deviation of expression was found to be predictive of seed weight, highlighting the importance of gene regulation for fitness and yield. A second study assessed the distribution of eQTL relative to their regulated genes and found considerable evidence of both tissue-specific and shared cis regulation. The study also revealed that long distance cis regulation at the scale of tens of kilobases is not an exception, with more than 20% of significant primary cis eQTL mapping more than 20kb from the regulated gene. The common variant eQTL were also found to be enriched among known functional annotations, suggesting the eQTL are also functional. A third study examined the capacity to associate variability in expression directly with terminal phenotypes of interest as a supplement linking genotype to phenotype. This transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) is a useful accessory to genotype based associations. In a combined test with genome-wide association results, TWAS improves the capacity to re-detect genes known to underlie oligogenic kernel phenotypes. This improves not only the capacity to link genes to phenotypes, but also underlines the widespread importance of regulation for phenotype.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:02Z (GMT).

Malting barley has not been grown in New York for about one hundred years, and, until recently, little was known about which barley pathogens would be problematic and what tools would best work to control them in New York. Genetic resistance is one of the most economical and effective ways to manage plant diseases, so cultivars of winter and spring barley were evaluated for disease resistance to natural populations of the pathogens causing scald (Rhynchosporium commune), spot blotch (Bipolaris sorokiniana), leaf rust (Puccinia hordei), powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei), and Fusarium head blight (Fusarium spp.). Data were collected from multiple locations over the course of three field seasons to determine the level of resistance each cultivar exhibited for each disease. In this process, spot blotch was identified as a potentially serious threat to spring barley. To prepare for greenhouse evaluations of spot blotch, an aggressive isolate of B. sorokiniana collected in New York was identified, inoculum production techniques were tested, and twelve cultivars were evaluated at seedling and adult growth stages to select susceptible and resistant check varieties. These techniques were implemented to screen a spring two-row barley population composed of diverse elite breeding lines for seedling response to spot blotch to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) using genome-wide association (GWA) mapping. Two QTL were identified on chromosomes 2H and 7H. The same population was planted in the field, and the lines were evaluated as adults for response to spot blotch, powdery mildew, leaf rust, and Fusarium head blight, using only natural inoculum. One QTL for powdery mildew resistance and two QTL for leaf rust resistance were identified.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-02T20:15:57Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Chen, Peng||Doerschuk, Peter	2018-10-22T17:24:04Z			5/30/18		The imaging capability of magnetic resonance force microscopy has been demonstrated with a 25 nm resolution spin-noise image of a single electron spin and a 4-to-10 nm resolution spin-noise image of few hundred nuclear spins.  A recent demonstration of hyperpolarization in a mechanically detected magnetic resonance experiment opens up new possibilities for utilizing polarized spin signal for nanoscale imaging.  In this thesis, we present our development of new image reconstruction methods for both nuclear spin ensembles and individual electron spins, and our signal-to-noise analysis to determine the quickest path to a highest-resolution image. First, we speed up the image-reconstruction process in spin noise imaging experiments by revising the iterative Landweber algorithm, and employing the Fourier convolution theorem to reduce the reconstruction time from three days to a few hours.  We invent a fast reconstruction scheme to further speed up the process, combining Fourier deconvolution and Tikhonov regularization.  This reconstruction scheme yields a three-dimensional image within a few minutes of calculation, but compromises the image signal-to-noise ratio by creating false peaks in the resulting image.  This problem of false peaks is resolved by a third reconstruction scheme based on Bayesian Monte Carlo calculation, capable of producing error bars for each pixel in the image. Second, we develop a new detection and image-reconstruction protocol for individual electron spins attached to a single biomolecule. The image-reconstruction algorithm combines a fast Fourier deconvolution with a rigorous Markov-chain reverse Monte Carlo calculation.  We demonstrate this new protocol via numerical simulations for a protein molecule with two nitroxide spin labels attached. The sparsely located electron spins allow three-dimensional coordinates of the spin labels to be reconstructed from a two-dimensional scanned signal map, reducing the required signal-acquisition time by 64-to-128 times compared to the three-dimensional scanning in previous imaging experiments. Finally, we derive the signal-to-noise ratios for Fourier-encoded imaging experiments in two polarization limits: detecting the spin fluctuations in the spin-noise limit, and detecting the Curie-law signal from hyperpolarized nuclear spins.  Our results indicate that hyperpolarization, when done right, can help reduce the signal-acquisition time in nanoscale imaging experiments and bring the three-dimensional image resolution to the sub-nanometer scale.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:04Z (GMT).

Increased intake of fruits and vegetables has been suggested to be one of major dietary factors reducing the risk of breast cancer. The health benefits were largely attributed to phytochemicals in fruits and vegetables. Ursolic acid (UA), a widely-distributed triterpenoid in fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices, has been reported to have anti-cancer activities. However, its mechanism of actions against breast cancer remain unclear.
 
The hypothesis of this study is that UA inhibits proliferation and invasion of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells via regulating cellular signal transduction pathways. Specific objectives are designed as: a) to investigate anti-proliferation and anti-invasion effects of UA in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells; b) To determine specific molecular targets of UA on cellular signal transduction pathways in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells; and c) to investigate potential synergistic effects of combining ursolic acid with paclitaxel toward breast cancer proliferation.
 
UA significantly inhibited proliferation of MDA-MDB-231 human breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner at the concentrations without cytotoxicity. The EC50 value of anti-proliferative activity was 30.67 ¬µM. UA at concentrations of 20, 30, and 40 ¬µM significantly inhibited cell invasion. Additional tests associated anti-invasion activity of UA with antagonizing the stimulation of EGF.
 
UA affected 8 targeted proteins in cellular signaling pathway in primary signaling screening. Akt, mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways were involved. Western blots indicated UA significantly downregulated EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation, which was correlated with reported inhibitory effects of UA on EGF-induced invasion. UA inhibited JAK/STAT3 and Akt activation, and downregulated NF-Œ∫B expression and activation.
 
UA, paclitaxel and their combination significantly inhibited proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Synergistic effect was observed at 95% inhibition rate in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and at 50% inhibition rate in MCF7 cells.
 
We demonstrated that UA exhibited inhibitory activity toward proliferation and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells via regulating cell signaling pathways. These data shed light on understanding the protective activity of plant foods against breast cancer."		12/31/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:42:17Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Monthly income fluctuates by about 20 percent on average from the annual mean for households below the poverty line and the concern is that these households face considerable consumption volatility as a result. The first two chapters study how state level expansions in SNAP eligibility between 1996 and 2011 have affected household income volatility using the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). I use a reduced form simulated instrument approach to isolate the impact of household eligibility gain on overall and non-SNAP income volatility (the latter captures the household behavioral response). My simulated instrument captures eligibility changes induced by state level changes to vehicle, asset and permanent resident eligibility rules. I further investigate household behavioral changes that are likely to be affected by the program, including hours worked and participation in other social safety net programs. I find that SNAP eligibility reduces total household income volatility of single mothers by a non-statistically significant 11 percent.

Such photonic devices are the most powerful because they can be manufactured at incredible scale, allowing us to either build them very cheaply or build large systems of photonic components, much like transistors and large-scale integrated circuits.  In this dissertation we make a leapfrog improvement in the state of the art of silicon photonics in two different areas: dramatically improving the performance of modulators using graphene and building large-scale silicon optical phased arrays with record-breaking efficiency and output beam quality.
	
The dissertation is divided into five chapters.  In the first, I introduce silicon photonics, discuss its capabilities and limitations, and summarize the key results of the dissertation.  In Chapter 2, I lay a theoretical framework for on-chip waveguides and ring resonators with a mathematical notation used throughout the thesis, as well as derive Fourier optics of optical phased arrays from first-principle scattering theory.  Chapter 3 details work on graphene ring modulators, including extensive fabrication and measurement details.  Chapter 4 continues with theoretical and experimental models of using graphene for highly linear and purely phase-based modulators.  Finally, Chapter 5 describes work on chip-scale optical phased arrays and a method for achieving half-wavelength emitter waveguide pitch."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:42:19Z (GMT).

So iron acquisition has become a major challenge in bacterial physiology. Iron acquisition includes uptake systems for elemental iron, ferric citrate, and various ferric-siderophore complexes. Iron-mediated regulation takes place at multi-levels: transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translational. These regulatory systems enable bacteria to achieve homeostatic balance with iron (Chapter 1).             Iron is also toxic at elevated levels. Recent results revealed that Fe(II) exporters play a crucial role in preventing iron overload. These include P1B-type ATPases, cation diffusion facilitators, major facilitator superfamily proteins, and membrane bound ferritin-like proteins (Chapter 2). Among these systems, FrvA is a virulence factor in Listeria monocytogenes. The characterization of FrvA as an Fe(II) efflux transporter provides the first direct evidence linking iron efflux to bacterial pathogenesis. Furthermore, FrvA is a high-affinity Fe(II) exporter and its expression imposes severe iron starvation in Bacillus subtilis (Chapter 3). Thus it has been employed as an inducible genetic tool to study iron limitation responses.              Iron acquisition and homeostasis systems need to be tightly regulated to ensure sufficiency for biological functions but not excess that would trigger intoxication. The ferric uptake regulator (Fur) monitors intracellular iron levels and plays a central role in maintaining bacterial iron homeostasis. However, it is unclear whether Fur-regulated genes are derepressed coordinately or in a sequential manner upon iron starvation. Here the iron limitation responses were characterized in B. subtilis (Chapter 4). In particular, the Fur-regulated genes are induced in three sequential waves in response to iron depletion: (i) cells increase their capacity for iron import from common sources of iron in the environment; (ii) cells turn on high-affinity siderophore-mediated import systems to scavenge iron; (iii) as iron levels decrease further, cells activate an iron-sparing response to remodel their proteome. This graded response correlates with in vivo occupancy of Fur protein and can be explained, at least in part, as a direct effect of differences in operator binding affinity of Fur protein. These results provide insights into the distinct roles of Fur-target genes and contribute to our understanding of bacterial metalloregulatory systems.		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:05Z (GMT).

Perovskite oxides and two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising classes of materials that exhibit intriguing properties such as high temperature superconductivity and spin-valley locking. Combining these materials into heterostructures offers even more functionality and is facilitated by a shared crystal structure (in the case of perovskites) or van der Waals bonds that do not require epitaxial relationships for clean interfaces (in the case of 2D materials). In this thesis, we present original studies of four materials within these broader classes. Thin films are fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and studied primarily through angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) measurements conducted at Cornell and the SOLEIL synchrotron in Gif-sur-Yvette, France. LaxBa1-xSnO3 (LBSO) is a high mobility perovskite oxide with a large band gap, enabling promising applications as a transparent conductor for use in solar energy harvesting or fully transparent electronics and as a channel material in all-oxide transistors. LBSO films are grown by MBE and studied by in situ ARPES. While the valence band structure is found to agree well with bulk density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a La-dependent upward band banding is observed at the surface. Additional exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light induces a reduction in the original band bending, offering a route for controlling carrier concentration and band offsets at LBSO interfaces. Graphene is a 2D semimetal with a host of exotic properties, including an extremely high mobility and tunable carrier concentration. Here, monolayer graphene is grown by CVD and studied by ex situ ARPES. Although the films originate from multiple nucleations, all individual graphene grains share the same crystallographic orientation, providing an ideal building block for van der Waals heterostructures with angle-tunable properties. Twisted graphene bilayers are fabricated from these growths and spatially resolved nano-ARPES reveals angle-dependent gaps in the graphene electronic structure, providing a route for creating devices with tunable optical absorption and exotic electronic states. Cu2Si is a 2D Dirac line node semimetal, a newly appreciated form of topological matter. Here we form van der Waals heterostructures of graphene and Cu2Si on Cu substrates by CVD, representing a unique interface between two atomically thin topological materials. SnSe2 is a layered main-group metal dichalcogenide that has exhibited gate-tunable superconductivity and has promising applications as a component in high efficiency two-dimensional heterojunction interlayer tunneling field effect transistors. However, despite decades of study, basic questions about its electronic structure remain unanswered. Here we synthesize thin films of SnSe2 by MBE and study them with ex situ ARPES. A comparison between ARPES and DFT reveals the importance of spin-orbit coupling and out-of-plane dispersion in the SnSe2 valence band structure, critical information for developing new electronic devices based on SnSe2.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:07Z (GMT).

In response to host defenses, most plant viruses have evolved mechanisms to interfere with sRNA biogenesis and activity, with broad effects on host homeostasis. This thesis includes studies on virus and viroid detection by searching for pathogen-specific nucleic acids and pathogen-derived sRNA products of the host defense machinery.  Two short reports describe the detection of Spinach latent virus and Australian grapevine viroid.  A third study describes the limited genetic diversity of Grapevine virus E infecting grapevines across the US. In a subsequent study, a combination of electron microscopy and next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies were used to elucidate the identity and complete genome sequence of another grapevine infecting virus, namely Grapevine asteroid mosaic associated virus; obtaining a full genome sequence allowed an examination and comparison of the genome‚Äôs functional domains and sequence signatures that reflect strategies for the expression and processing of the virus encoded proteins. Finally, to better understand the role of sRNAs in the regulation of gene expression, a genome wide evaluation was performed of the biogenesis and activity of two kinds of sRNAs, microRNAs and phased interfering small interfering RNAs. Using a combination of multiple types of NGS datasets and the design of a custom bioinformatics pipeline, a broad scale sRNA-mediated regulatory network was described. Evaluation of the network‚Äôs regulatory contribution indicated that sRNA-mediated regulation plays a major role in gene expression. A large proportion of genes in Arabidopsis thaliana were found to be controlled by sRNAs, including genes involved in most biological processes. Finally, the role of sRNAs as key regulators was further confirmed by the extended number of genes under sRNA control that are involved in others aspects of regulation, in particular transcription factors.

In this dissertation, I explore several hydrodynamical processes in accretion disks, primarily using numerical hydrodynamics simulations. I study the effect of viscosity on unstable oscillation modes in disks around black holes, showing that it can either suppress or enhance instability. I study the effect of a vortex instability that may arise at the edges of dead zones in protoplanetary disks, showing that it can transport angular momentum through the disk, as well as trap dust, with the latter process resulting in observable morphological features. I investigate the resonant truncation of disks in binaries when they are misaligned with the binary orbital plane, showing that misaligned disks around stars with companions are larger than aligned disks, and that misaligned circumbinary disks generally have smaller cavities than aligned disks. I undertake a comprehensive investigation of the dynamics and evolution of circumbinary disks, with a particular emphasis on the transfer of angular momentum between the disk and binary. I find that circumbinary disks may cause binaries to expand, contrary to the typical expectation that disks tend to harden binaries. Finally, I investigate the migration of a low-mass planets near the inner edge of protoplanetary disk, and show that interactions with the inner edge halt the migration of the planet when its orbital radius is several times larger than the inner disk radius.

Malting barley has not been grown in New York for about one hundred years, and, until recently, little was known about which barley pathogens would be problematic and what tools would best work to control them in New York. Genetic resistance is one of the most economical and effective ways to manage plant diseases, so cultivars of winter and spring barley were evaluated for disease resistance to natural populations of the pathogens causing scald (Rhynchosporium commune), spot blotch (Bipolaris sorokiniana), leaf rust (Puccinia hordei), powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei), and Fusarium head blight (Fusarium spp.). Data were collected from multiple locations over the course of three field seasons to determine the level of resistance each cultivar exhibited for each disease. In this process, spot blotch was identified as a potentially serious threat to spring barley. To prepare for greenhouse evaluations of spot blotch, an aggressive isolate of B. sorokiniana collected in New York was identified, inoculum production techniques were tested, and twelve cultivars were evaluated at seedling and adult growth stages to select susceptible and resistant check varieties. These techniques were implemented to screen a spring two-row barley population composed of diverse elite breeding lines for seedling response to spot blotch to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) using genome-wide association (GWA) mapping. Two QTL were identified on chromosomes 2H and 7H. The same population was planted in the field, and the lines were evaluated as adults for response to spot blotch, powdery mildew, leaf rust, and Fusarium head blight, using only natural inoculum. One QTL for powdery mildew resistance and two QTL for leaf rust resistance were identified.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:42:24Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Specifically, the problem of detecting a few anomalous processes among a large number of processes is considered. The rare events may represent opportunities with exceptional returns or anomalies associated with high costs or potential catastrophic consequences. Examples include financial trading opportunities and transmission opportunities in dynamic spectrum access,  endogenous extreme events or exogenous attacks in communication and computer networks, etc.  For all these applications, the problem of searching for the rare has the following defining features: (i) the massive search space; (ii) the need for high detection accuracy, especially in terms of missing a rare event; (iii) the time sensitivity of the problem, either due to the transient nature of opportunities or the urgency for taking recourse measures in the face of anomalies. The goal is thus to detect the rare events as quickly and as reliably as possible when the total number of hypotheses is large and the observations are probabilistic thus inherently ambiguous. The performance measure of interest is sample complexity (the total number of observations which represents the detection delay)  with respect to the size of the search space and the required detection accuracy. The key to a sublinear scaling in the problem size is to exploit the hierarchical structure of the search space inherent to many applications. In the first part of the dissertation, we develop an algorithm for the anomaly detection of which the sample complexity is in optimal scaling with the size of the search space. We consider the case where the observations from all the processes are noiseless. The anomaly detection problem falls into the general class of the group testing problem. We consider the quantitative group testing problem where the objective is to identify defective items in a given population based on results of tests performed on subsets of the population. Under the quantitative group testing model, the result of each test reveals the number of defective items in the tested group. We establish the optimal nested test plan in closed form which achieves the minimum number of tests by nested test plans. This optimal nested test plan is also order-optimal among all test plans as the population size approaches infinity. Using heavy-hitter detection as a case study, we show via simulation examples orders of magnitude improvement of the group testing approach over two prevailing sampling-based approaches in detection accuracy and counter consumption. In the second part of the dissertation, we develop an algorithm for the anomaly detection problem of which the sample complexity achieves optimal scaling with the size of the search space as well as the accuracy requirements. We consider the case where the observations from the processes are noisy and the noisy observations are specific by general distributions. Aggregated observations can be taken from a chosen subset of processes, where the chosen subset conforms to a binary tree structure. The random observations are drawn from a general distribution that may depend on the size of the chosen subset and the number of anomalous processes in the subset. We propose a sequential search strategy by devising an information-directed random walk (IRW) on the tree-structured observation hierarchy. Subject to a reliable constraint, the proposed policy is shown to be asymptotically optimal in terms of detection accuracy. Furthermore, it achieves the optimal logarithmic-order sample complexity in the in terms of the size of the search space provided that the Kullback-Liebler divergence between aggregated observations in the presence and the absence of anomalous processes are bounded away from zero at all levels of the tree structure as the size of the search space approaches infinity. Sufficient conditions on the decaying rate of the aggregated observations to pure noise under which a sublinear scaling in the size of the search space is preserved are also identified for the Bernoulli case.  The algorithms proposed in both of the two parts are adaptive test plans which are deterministic with search actions explicitly specified at each given time. They involve little online computation beyond calculating the sample mean or the sum log-likelihood ratio. The inherent tree structure of the also leads to low memory requirement. They are thus particularly attractive for online applications.		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:08Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The GBM‚Äìgrape complex represents an excellent system to explore the chemically-mediated mechanisms of host plant location because the GBM is an ovipositional specialist, meaning gravid females discriminate between host and non-host plants.  Additionally, synthetic blends of host plant volatiles have already been shown to attract GBM females in the flight tunnel (Cha et al. 2008).  Therefore the GBM-grape complex was used to test the existing theories regarding host plant location.  I used flight tunnel assays to observe GBM responses to host and non-host odor sources (cut shoots, extracts, and synthetic blends), and isolate and identify the volatiles that elicit the observed behavior.  All antennally active compounds found in grape shoots were also present in non-host plants.  Moths displayed higher levels of upwind flight than expected to non-host sources, suggesting discrimination is not occurring at a distance.  I used additional flight tunnel assays, to investigate cues necessary to elicit landing on an odor source (water vapor and visual cues). Individual and paired stimuli did not elicit landing, and landing only occurred when plant volatiles, a visual cue, and water vapor were all present, suggesting the cues have a synergistic effect.  Interestingly, moths flew upwind a low percentage of the time in response to water vapor alone suggesting the moths can use nonspecific cues to locate a host.  In a final study, I explored whether microorganisms living on the surface of plant shoots produced the behaviorally active compounds. Volatile collections of surface sterilized plant shoots indicated the surface microorganisms did not significantly contribute to the volatile profile of the grape shoots as all of the peaks in the volatile profile of sanitized shoots were found in the profile of control shoots. In flight tunnel assays, moths responded similarly to sanitized shoots as they did to control shoots suggesting surface microorganisms did not play a significant role in the production of previously identified blend of behaviorally active volatiles.

Beyond cost savings, research to date has been inconclusive on the consequences for employees.  The increasingly unstructured nature of these offices, both physically and psychologically, may operate differently based on individual differences in personality.  By performing secondary research analyzing data from a case study, this paper investigates the moderating effects of Big Five personality traits on the effect of a flex office on workplace satisfaction, employee engagement, and interaction-based work experience.  The present study analyzes survey data collected from one site of a U.S.-based research and consulting organization.  A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to compare survey responses at four months after a pilot group‚Äôs (n = 53, 55% female) transition to a flex office with a control group in a traditional cellular office (n = 65, 42% female).  Drawing on perspectives from the Five Factor Model, personality-based self-regulation, and Person-Environment Fit, this paper hypothesizes that higher ratings in personality traits of Emotional Stability, Conscientiousness, Extraversion and Agreeableness will support positive outcomes for employees in the pilot versus the control.  Results indicate that employees who rate highly in Conscientiousness and Agreeableness, independently, have better overall work experience in flex offices versus employees who rate moderately on these dimensions.  Highly conscientious employees have significantly more awareness of their colleagues‚Äô expertise and their departments‚Äô activities in a flex office versus a traditional cellular office.

Integrated microresonators enhance the interaction between light and matter, enabling greater precision and control of light for a wide range of applications, including optical communications, sensing, and signal generation. This dissertation presents demonstrations of silicon photonic devices based on microresonators being used for switching, modulation, lasing, and four-wave mixing.  Silicon waveguides have the potential for extremely high bandwidth density and can use multiplexing approaches similar to those emerging in fiber communications networks. Spatial multiplexing uses a new degree of freedom to expand bandwidth capacity in waveguides. Mode-multiplexed waveguides in silicon enable such high capacities and help relieve design constraints related to the use of multiple lasers.  Here new functionalities for integrated mode-division multiplexing are presented. A fully-reconfigurable switch supporting multiple spatial modes and wavelengths is demonstrated. Additionally, an on-chip multimode link with three modes is demonstrated using integrated modulators.  In another demonstration, a silicon nitride microresonator is used in a hybrid semiconductor laser cavity to provide resonant feedback. A narrow laser linewidth is achieved by leveraging the length enhancement of the microresonator. Coherent communications and other phase-sensitive applications rely on such narrow laser linewidths. In the final demonstration, which is a highlight of this dissertation, a fully-integrated frequency comb source is demonstrated. For the first time, a Kerr frequency comb is generated in an integrated microresonator without the need for an external laser. Soliton mode-locked combs are generated with extremely low power consumption, allowing battery operation of the compact comb source. This result could allow ubiquitous deployment of precise optical devices for sensing, spectroscopy, timing, and communications.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:09Z (GMT).

In the first essay, I study the role of default risk spillovers on an intra-industry setting and its relevance to equity return predictability. In the second essay, I empirally explore the relationship between default risk and informed trading in the Credit Default Swap (CDS) and equity market. In Chapter 1, I describe the two methods used for estimating the probability of default. The first one, which is used for generating the data for this thesis is named dynamic discrete-time hazard rate model with industry fixed effects as in Chava and Jarrow (2004), and the second one is a structural approach titled Merton‚Äôs distance to default (DD) studied in Vassalou and Xing (2004). I go over the pros and cons of each method and the motivation of why the former is used for this study. In summary, the hazard rate method has a higher out-of-sample predictive power, does not assume that all assets of a firm trade which is an unrealistic assumption made by the structural model, and Distance to Default variable if included in the hazard rate model does not have any incremental power as shown in Campbell et al. (2008). In Chapter 2, ‚ÄúDefault Risk Spillovers and Intra-Industry Return Predictabil- ity‚Äù, I observe that stocks far from the most distressed stocks in their industry earn significantly higher future returns. I connect less distressed stocks to the most distressed stocks in their industry through Œ≤‚àídistance and common insti- tutional ownership. Disconnectedness forecasts higher future returns, especially when returns of the most distressed stocks are high. A one standard devia- tion increase in disconnectedness with the most distressed stocks increases next month returns by 0.53%. A strategy that buys stocks that are far from the dis- tressed firms and sells stocks near the distressed firms yields 7.44% annualized Fama French five-factor alpha with t-statistic 3.22. I argue that this predictability arises through an intra-industry default risk propagation mechanism, which af- fects the liquidation value of connected firms‚Äô assets. Predictability is strongest in industries with the lowest levels of asset redeployability. Taken together, these findings suggest that intra-industry distress risk spillovers predict equity returns. In Chapter 3 (joint with Gaurav Kankanhalli), ‚ÄúDefault Risk and Informed Trading: Evidence from the CDS Market‚Äù, in a sample of the 520 most frequently-traded single-name non-sovereign credit default swaps (CDS), we find evidence of a non-monotonic relationship between informed trading (prox- ied by PIN) and quoted CDS spreads, as a function of default risk (proxied by reduced-form estimates of default probability, or DP). Unconditionally, higher PIN is associated with higher quoted CDS spreads, as predicted by models with market makers facing an adverse selection problem. However, conditional on higher DP, the marginal effect of PIN on spreads decreases. This is consistent with the notion that at higher levels of default risk the private signals of in- formed traders have less value, reducing the adverse selection problem faced by the market maker and, at the margin, reducing spreads. VAR analysis confirms that the private signal of informed traders is informative about future default risk, as lagged PIN predicts lead , but only at shorter horizons. An investment strategy that buys low PIN low DP stocks and sells high PIN high DP stocks earns average daily returns of 0.13% and average daily Fama-French 3-factor alpha of 0.17% (with a t-statistic of 4.86). Taken together, our results provide new insights into the joint dynamics of informed trading and default risk, and their implications on CDS spreads and equity returns.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:09Z (GMT).

This laboratory plasma jet research focused on characterizing and quantifying the effects of extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) and an externally applied axial magnetic field ($B_{z}$). In the present research, plasma jets were formed from Joule heating and ablation of radial foils (approximately 15~$\mu$m thin circular disks) using a pulsed power generator (COBRA) with 1~MA peak current and 100~ns rise time. Plasma dynamics of the jet were diagnosed under a change of current polarities, which correspond to current moving either radially outward or inward from the foil's central axis. The influence of the Hall effect on the jet development was observed under opposite current polarities, which changed the jet conical structure (width and angle). Additionally, we studied the effects on jet dynamics resulting from varying the $B_{z}$ from 0 to 2~T. The plasma jet formation compressed the $B_{z}$ as the plasma converged toward the central z-axis. The pressure from the $B_{z}$ compression led to on-axis density hollowing of the jet. Experimental measurements of this compression were made using $dB/dt$ (or ``B-dot'') magnetic probes placed in the center of the hollow plasma jet. Additionally, we found that the plasma jet formation disrupted from the ablating foil surface with a large enough applied $B_{z}$, meaning the jet was no longer well-collimated but was ejected as multiple bursts of plasma. We observed that the critical $B_{z}$ for disruption depended upon the foil material (Al, Ti, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, W) and correlated with material properties of the foil such as the electrical resistivity and equation of state. Experimental results were compared with predictions made by XMHD numerical simulations (PERSEUS). This study of 1) the Hall effect, 2) applied magnetic field effects, and 3) the process of foil ablation permitted further understanding of fundamental physics topics including 1) the importance of low-density plasmas within high-density plasma environments, 2) how magnetic forces influence plasma dynamics, and 3) the impact of material properties during transitions from the solid through plasma phases.

The need to dramatically scale this platform for communications applications has led to active research in switching and multiplexing signals using different degrees-of-freedom of light such as path, wavelength, and the transverse spatial mode. In recent years, extending the platform to use new materials has allowed for a new range of applications such as quantum optics, biosensing, and spectroscopy that span the visible to mid-infrared wavelength range. Fully utilizing this platform allows an unparalleled level of control over a large set of optical channels in waveguides with reconfiguration capability, low power consumption, and more stability which can be applied to this broad range of applications. This allows large table-top optical setups for quantum optics and microscopy to be miniaturized to the compact footprint of a nanophotonics chip.
Here in this dissertation, we extend this multiplexing nanophotonic platform into the visible wavelength regime in order to address two areas that require high density optical channels: quantum optics and neural interfaces for optogenetics. We develop a platform based on low-loss silicon nitride waveguides that can be thermally tuned using integrated microheaters to introduce reconfigurability in the visible wavelength range. We show how nanophotonic optical channels can be used for both quantum interference as well as neuron activation within the brain.
To scale up the integrated quantum optics platform, we developed nanophotonics building blocks that utilize the transverse spatial modes within a single multimode waveguide for key quantum interference experiments that form the basis of more complex transformations within a smaller footprint. We used the transverse spatial degree-of-freedom because it can be controlled by simple geometric design, relieves the burden on the light source, and does not require non-standard materials, long delay lines, and high speed electronics, which is the case for time and frequency encoding.  The high confinement of the silicon nitride allows for well separated modes that can be accessed by using geometry controlled selective phase matching. We demonstrated quantum interference using the higher order modes within a single multimode waveguide. We demonstrated both passive and active tuning of the interference between different modes while maintaining high visibility interference in the quantum regime.
To address the reconfiguration and resolution limitations of current optogenetic neural studies, we developed an implantable neural probe with an embedded reconfigurable nanophotonic switching network for creating high resolution spatiotemporal optical patterns. We use the same silicon nitride platform redesigned for the blue wavelength range. Using full phase control within a path interferometer network, we demonstrated a fully reconfigurable 1x8 switch that can control an array of microbeams to excite single neurons on a 20 microsecond timescale, much faster than neuron response times. We developed packaging techniques for the implantable nanophotonic chip for in vivo studies. We show for the first time precisely defined and repeatable neural spike patterns in vivo with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Finally, we discuss how this platform can be extended for large-scale neural studies."		12/18/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-03T18:42:22Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Beginning with a unique typology for detecting abusive language, we outline the distinctions and similarities of different abusive language subtasks (offensive language, hate speech, cyberbullying and trolling) and how we might benefit from the progress made in each area. Specifically, we suggest that each subtask can be categorized based on whether or not the abusive language being studied 1) is directed at a specific individual, or targets a generalized ``Other" and 2) the extent to which the language is explicit versus implicit. We then use knowledge gained from this typology to tackle the ``problem of offensive language" in hate speech detection. A key challenge for automated hate speech detection on social media is the separation of hate speech from other instances of offensive language. We present a Logistic Regression classifier, trained on human annotated Twitter data, that makes use of a uniquely derived lexicon of hate terms along with features that have proven successful in the detection of offensive language, hate speech and cyberbullying. Using the tweets classified by the aforementioned hate speech classifier, we extract a set of users for which we collect demographic and psychological attributes, with the goal of understanding how these attributes are related to hate speech use. We first present a binary Random Forest classifier for predicting whether or not a Twitter user is a hate speaker. We then explore the use of linear and Random Forest regression models as a means of explaining and predicting levels of hate speech use based on user attributes. To the best of my knowledge, this work is the first to present an automated approach for detecting individual hate speakers. Finally, we present a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for identifying polarized groups using tripartite graphs (user-post-tag) gleaned from social media data. This work is heavily inspired by the need for an unsupervised approach that works well in contexts varying in the nature of the controversy, the level of polarization, the number of polarity groups involved, and the presence of neutral entities.  I present the first ever analysis of polarization on data from the Tumblr platform, showing improved performance over traditional community detection methods and the state-of-the-art method of NMF on bipartite graphs.

We use the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI) with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reference evapotranspiration to construct the first high-resolution (4 km) drought atlas for the Caribbean spanning 1950 to near-present. We find a significant drying in the Caribbean and Central America, which contrast with a relatively (but not-significant) wetting of Florida Peninsula during the period analyzed. We also find that the 2013‚Äì2016 ‚ÄúPan-Caribbean drought‚Äù is the worst dry interval observed in the Caribbean during the period analyzed, and according to our results, anthropogenic warming contributed to 16‚Äì18% of its severity. Anthropogenic warming also contributed to ~7% of the Caribbean Islands that experienced drought conditions during the Pan-Caribbean drought, which roughly represents ~16,800 km2. We also find that during droughts that occurred in 1997‚Äì1998, 2009‚Äì2010, and 2013‚Äì2016, a predominant moisture divergence over the Caribbean Sea and northeastern South America correlates to anomalous dry conditions and negative precipitation minus evaporation (P‚ÄìE) values in the Caribbean. However, moisture convergence is also observed at local scales during these droughts, especially on the eastern coast of Central America and Florida Peninsula. These results are consistent with previous work that suggest a strong moisture divergence in northeastern South America as a critical driver of drought during El Ni√±o events in northeastern South America and/or southeastern Caribbean Islands. The results from this dissertation provides further insights into the nature of drought in the Caribbean and Central America, useful for researchers and stakeholders alike. This is especially important, since climate models consistently project a significant drying over the Caribbean and Central America the coming decades due to anthropogenic climate change.

Symptoms of the disease include browning of the berry skin, oozing of the berry pulp and the smell of acetic acid, all in the presence of Drosophila spp. We established a method of diagnosing sour rot that includes (i) a rating scale for characterizing visual symptoms of sour rot, which includes the defining characteristic of loss of berry integrity, and (ii) a quantitative measurement of acetic acid content within the berry. Through the isolation of microbes associated with sour rot, and inoculation experiments, we identified several yeast (Metschnikowia spp., Pichia spp., Saccharomyces sp.) and acetic acid bacteria (Acetobacter sp. and Gluconobacter spp.) that successfully cause sour rot symptoms, when in the presence of Drosophila fruit flies. We conducted three years of replicated field trials on the Vitis interspecific hybrid cv. Vignoles, in which we targeted these organisms through pre-harvest applications of various antimicrobial agents and an insecticide both alone and in combination. In a separate set of experiments, the use of Illumina sequencing allowed us to characterize the microbial changes on the grape berry surface at five key phenological stages: pea-sized, bunch closure, Veraison, 15¬∞ Brix and harvest in 2014 through 2016 in the Finger Lakes, New York, and 2016 in Tasmania, Australia. The results of this study suggest that terroir is dynamic at the microbial scale, varying significantly not just between regions but also within a region and among years. Finally, grape endophytic microbes were isolated on media conducive to fungi or bacteria and subsequently identified by Illumina sequencing.  Species of the yeast genera Metschnikowia, Pichia, and Hanseniaspora were recovered from every set of samples, as were species of the bacterial genera Acinetobacter, Burkholderia and Bacillus; species of the bacterial genera Acetobacter and Gluconobacter also were recovered from vineyard samples from New York and Tasmania and from supermarket-purchased grapes. The endophytic presence of these microbes within grape berries has implications with respect not only to the potential development of sour rot but also to the broader concept of microbial terroir.

We show that this problem is NP-hard, but demonstrate an algorithm that works well in practice. Applications include calibrating goniometers for accurate measurement of light reflection. We then proceed further down the pipeline from measurement of light reflection to the modeling of the appearance of surfaces. Specifically, we examine the appearance of wood. While suitable BRDF models exist, the texture parameter maps for these wood BRDFs are difficult to author---good results have been shown with elaborate measurements for small flat samples, but these models are not much used in practice. Furthermore, mapping 2D image textures onto 3D objects leads to distortion and inconsistencies. Procedural volumetric textures solve these geometric problems, but existing methods produce much lower quality than image textures. This chapter aims to bring the best of all these techniques together: we present a comprehensive volumetric simulation of wood appearance, including growth rings, color variation, pores, rays, and growth distortions. The fiber directions required for anisotropic specular figure follow naturally from the distortions. The final piece of the dissertation is another application of numerical optimization, this time in games, both in the sense of entertainment and in the sense of game theory. A key challenge in game design is achieving balance between the strategies available to the players. We model the balancing problem as modifying a zero-sum game, using one variable per strategy, so that every strategy has an incentive to be employed. We begin with a special case where these variables affect player payoffs multiplicatively, and show that the simple Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm can be used to balance the game. We then proceed to analyze the more general case where the variables have a monotonic effect on payoffs, and show that it is amenable to standard optimization methods.

These plants are characterized by unique bracteate reproductive displays, which have excited interest in their reproductive biology. This dissertation examines aspects of systematics and reproductive biology in Tacca. 	The first chapter puts forward a phylogenetic study of relationships within Tacca J.R. Forst. & G. Forst., supplementing previous molecular phylogenetic and pre-cladistic taxonomic studies. Species, exemplar, and outgroup sampling are expanded. Multiple sources of data, molecular and morphological, are used for phylogenetic inference. This is used to interpret morphological evolution in various plant organs in the genus. 	The second chapter presents a comparative analysis of the genes and plastome structures of single representatives from Tacca and sister genus Thismia. The plastomes were sequenced using next-generation technology and generated using de novo assembly programs. The plastid genome of Thismia is among the smallest known quadripartite plastomes. The plastome of Tacca is more similar to other autotrophic members of Dioscoreaceae than to Thismia  	The third chapter documents an investigation into floral visitors of Tacca cristata Jack. Existing research on the pollination and reproductive biology of Tacca demonstrate low levels of outcrossing and likely autogamous selfing. Based on visual observations and field collections of insect visitors to natural populations, this study suggests that insect visitation may result in pollination of showy members of Tacca to some extent. 	The fourth chapter proposes to resurrect and lectotypify Tacca artocarpifolia Seem., a species currently in taxonomic synonymy. This is done based on examination and measurements made from photographs, live material, and herbarium specimens, including all named syntypes."		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:14Z (GMT).

Ober, Christopher Kemper||Knepper, Ross A.	2018-10-22T17:24:21Z			5/30/18		As robots transition from industrial automation tools to devices that interact directly with humans, new hardware is needed to ensure that these interactions are safe and comfortable for the user. Soft robots use elastomeric materials with low mechanical compliance to create systems that are intrinsically safe for human interaction. This work develops fabrication techniques and materials systems that impart soft robotics with dexterous movement, tactile sensing and visual expression. A digital mask projection stereolithography (DMP-SL) system is developed to directly 3D print soft, pneumatic actuators. The mechanical properties of a commercially available, photopolymerizable elastomeric material are characterized and numerical simulations are used to design pleated actuators that achieve large overall deformations with small local strains. Antagonistic pairs are combined to achieve high degree of freedom (DOF) actuators with cycle times that rival high speed contraction in animal muscle. In order to enable feedback control and visual expression, an electroluminescent skin is developed using hyperelastic light emitting capacitors (HLECs). The HLEC is composed of transparent hydrogel electrodes that sandwich a ZnS phosphordoped dielectric elastomer layer. Under a high electric field, the HLEC emits light while stretching uniaxially to >480% strain. This deformation results in a measureable change in capacitance. The HLEC is integrated into the skin of a soft robot, providing it with dynamic coloration and sensory feedback from external and internal stimuli. To enable applications in human-computer interaction, a portable, battery-powered control system is developed for four HLECs embedded in a flat sheet. This sheet turns into a dome when pressurized, forming a tactile interface with dynamic coloration. The co-located touch sensing and light-emitting capabilities of this system are demonstrated by developing an interactive memory game.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:21Z (GMT).

Systemic risk is a broad term used to describe economic and financial system breakdown. Its characterization can depend on the sources being explored. Fully understanding its nature is imperative, especially if we want to understand the causes and consequences of big economic meltdowns like the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Policies designed without proper understanding of systemic risk are likely to be either ineffective or have unforeseen ramifications. Thus, there is a need for a variety of models that explore different aspects of systemic risk. The first chapter of this dissertation studies systemic risk as it relates to financial innovation in a stationary equilibrium. The second chapter studies the transition dynamics aspect. Since these two chapters are based on the same underlying economic model, they are jointly introduced and concluded. In these chapters a heterogeneous agents model in continuous time, driven by jump-diffusion processes, is developed. Methods from the theory of Levy Processes and Feynman Path Integral are introduced. This approach allows for analytically exploring various properties of systemic risk. We derive explicit expressions of the financial sector's failure probability, its capital position at the random time of credit event, and the transition densities of the leverage and financial wealth distributions. We show that financial innovation can either increase or decrease systemic risk under some conditions. We characterize the notion of a leverage trap -- once the economy moves to high leverage systemic risk states, it tends to stay there. Financial innovation amplifies credit cycles. Transition speed increases (decreases) when the economy is leveraging up (deleveraging).  The third chapter studies how asset price bubbles, market liquidity, and trading constraints affect systemic risk. We build an equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents in which market liquidity is modeled as a stochastic quantity impact from trading on the price. We introduce a different framework for analyzing rational asset price bubbles, which are shown to exist in equilibrium due to heterogeneous beliefs, heterogeneous preferences, and binding trading constraints. Positive price bubbles are larger in illiquid markets and when trading constraints are more binding. A realization of systemic risk, defined as the risk of market failure due to an exogenous shock to the economy, results in a significant loss of wealth as agents are unable to meet their trading constraints and default. Systemic risk is shown to increase as: (i) the fraction of agents seeing an asset price bubble increases, (ii) as the market becomes more illiquid, and (iii) as trading constraints are relaxed.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:22Z (GMT).

ea53fd7e-5036-4be0-b675-279a90e38174	123456789/41792			Hitomi, Nozomi		Selva Valero, Daniel		Peck, Mason||Reed, Patrick Michael	2018-10-22T17:24:22Z			5/30/18		Distributed spacecraft missions (DSM) are gaining traction in the space community for the potential to deploy multiple simple and low-cost spacecraft to provide high temporal resolution of observations over regions of interest. Designing a DSM, however, remains challenging due to the many architectural decisions involved at both the spacecraft-level and system-level and due to the presence of multiple conflicting objectives of maximizing performance while minimizing cost and risk. One proven approach to architecting DSMs is to gather a team of design experts from multiple disciplines and leverage their combined experiences to quickly identify a few feasible mission architectures. The rapid design process allows the team to refine the design problem several times to better capture the stakeholders' needs. A typical design team, however, only explores a handful of alternative missions, which limits their understanding of the key design decisions that determine a DSM's metrics. Another popular approach is to convert the design problem into an optimization problem and rely on search algorithms to explore more of the tradespace. In particular, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) have shown promise on DSM design problems, but they are considered computationally inefficient because they generally don't leverage the available domain- or problem-specific knowledge. To identify promising missions, MOEAs require evaluating hundreds or thousands of candidate solutions using computationally expensive simulations to compute their metrics. These computational burdens hinder designers from iterating through multiple problem formulations.  This thesis proposes a new tradespace exploration tool that combines the efficiency of expert design heuristics with the explorative power of an MOEA. The tool exploits the available expert knowledge to push the exploration to the most promising regions of the tradespace while searching other regions of the tradespace for novel solutions not captured by the knowledge. First, expert design knowledge is encoded as knowledge-dependent operators so that they can easily be incorporated into MOEAs. Next, an MOEA is augmented with an adaptive operator selection strategy (AOS) that allows an MOEA to efficiently utilize multiple evolutionary operators by constantly monitoring each operator's ability to create high-quality solutions and adapting the search strategy to apply the most effective ones. Given several knowledge-dependent operators along with conventional, knowledge-independent operators, the AOS can explore the tradespace by leveraging both the expert design heuristics and the explorative power of an MOEA. This thesis also develops an MOEA that can extract new knowledge by applying a data mining algorithm to candidate solutions generated during an optimization run. This tool is useful when there are few or no design heuristics available for a given problem. The proposed tool encodes the extracted knowledge as evolutionary operators and uses them  with an AOS to guide the remainder of the optimization process. The extracted knowledge is also provided to the user in an easy-to-understand form, with the hope that the information can help decipher the results and elucidate the key design decisions. The efficacy of the proposed tradespace exploration tools are demonstrated on a DSM design problem for climate monitoring. The results shows that combining an MOEA with knowledge from experts or data mining algorithms leads to significant improvements in computational efficiency over a conventional MOEA.		12/4/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:22Z (GMT).

In my dissertation, I clarify how these authors articulate philosophy and poetry into a single one discipline ‚Äì a lyric science ‚Äì devise its thinking tools, and urge us to consider love as the defining experience of human life, and the gateway to knowledge. The results of this experiment can be summarized in four key-terms which name the different chapters of my dissertation: likeness, bewilderment, sweetness, and excess. Chapter 1. ‚ÄúIrresistible likeness: Al cor gentil rimpaira sempre amor‚Äù is dedicated to Guinizzelli‚Äôs poetical manifesto, in which he challenges the primacy of logical argumentation by devising a mode of thinking based on resemblance, likeness. Chapter 2. ‚ÄúBewildering love: Donna me prega‚Äù deals with Cavalcanti‚Äôs response to Guinizzelli‚Äôs manifesto, in which he devises a theory of bewilderment, an experience of love as destructive, disconnecting, and eventually mortal. However, Cavalcantian love also works positively, since it manifests the basic structures of human‚Äôs intellect. Chapter 3 ‚ÄúUnfinished praise: Donne ch‚Äôavete intelletto d‚Äôamore‚Äù analyzes how Dante lays out the ground work to connect Cavalcanti and Gunizzelli‚Äôs approaches into a comprehensive doctrine of love. Lightness and sweetness are Dante‚Äôs provisional solutions to transforms the deadly experience of love into a positive and salvific one, eventually lay the ground for his opus magnum, the Comedia. In chapter 4, I investigate the use of the term superchio (‚Äúexcess‚Äù) in Michelangelo‚Äôs poetry in relationship to grace, love, and art. Over the course of the analysis two important traits of Michelangelo‚Äôs poetry emerge: the use of analogy to structure his verses, and the use of highly antithetical ‚Äì if not contradictory ‚Äì logic to express his key concepts concerning art, grace, and love.

This has long been a central concern for many sociologists, political scientists, and human-right activists, among others. Voice has also gotten the attention of the Computer Scientists, especially of some researchers of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Information and Communication Technology and Development (ICTD) in recent years, and various computing systems have been built to help people raise their voice in various contexts. However, the core challenges for designing appropriate computing technologies to support the voices of marginalized communities have mostly been unexplored. In this thesis, I have explored the theoretical and technical aspects of voice that are important to conceptualize the idea of voice and to design for it. This thesis presents a broad theoretical definition of voice based on the historical development of the ideas of justice and democracy, which are essential to understanding the politics and poetics of silencing. This thesis then advances two important notions of voice - ‚Äúvoice as a value‚Äù, and ‚Äúvoice as a process‚Äù. Furthermore, this thesis highlights three major components of voice that are necessary both for conceptualizing the idea of voice and for designing technologies to support a voice‚Äì access, autonomy, and accountability. These three components of voice are explained through three major projects that I completed during my Ph.D. at Cornell University. The first project is called ‚ÄúSuhrid‚Äù, and it was conducted with a group of low-literate rickshaw drivers in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Suhrid demonstrates the complexities around ‚Äòaccess‚Äô without which voice is not possible. The second project presented in this thesis is called ‚ÄúProtibadi‚Äù, which reveals the challenges with ‚Äòautonomy‚Äô by demonstrating the hardship of Bangladeshi women in voicing their experiences with sexual harassment. The third project focuses on the tensions around ‚Äòaccountqbility‚Äô - an inseparable component of voice. This project is based on my study to understand the public reactions to a recent government order in Bangladesh that has enforced the registration of each mobile SIM card with the biometric information of its owner. These three projects, as a set, define the concept of and complexities around voice, and demonstrate the challenges around design ng for access, autonomy, and accountability. This thesis thus contributes to the growing interest in Computer Science, HCI, and ICTD around social justice, inequality, empowerment, and international development.

For example, today's mobile SoCs rely on accelerators to perform compute-intensive tasks, and datacenters are starting to deploy accelerators for applications such as web search and machine learning. This trend is expected to continue and future systems will contain more specialized accelerators. However, the traditional hardware-oriented accelerator design methodology is costly and inefficient because it requires significant manual effort in the design process. This development model is unsustainable in the future where a wide variety of accelerators are expected to be designed for a large number of applications. To solve this problem, the development cost of accelerators must be drastically reduced, which calls for more productive design methodologies that can create high-quality accelerators with low manual effort. This thesis addresses the above challenge with architectural frameworks that combine novel accelerator architectures with automated design and optimization frameworks to enable designing high-performance and energy-efficient accelerators with minimal manual effort. Specifically, the first part of the thesis proposes a framework for automatically generating accelerators that can effectively tolerate long, variable memory latencies, which improves performance and reduces design effort by removing the need to manually create data preloading logic. The framework leverages architecture mechanisms such as memory prefetching and access/execute decoupling, as well as automated compiler analysis to generate accelerators that can intelligently preload data needed in the future from the main memory. The second part of the thesis proposes a framework for building parallel accelerators that leverage concepts from task-based parallel programming, which enables software programmers to quickly create high-performance accelerators using familiar parallel programming paradigms, without needing to know low-level hardware design knowledge. The framework uses a computation model that supports dynamic parallelism in addition to static parallelism, and includes a flexible architecture that supports dynamic scheduling to enable mapping a wide range of parallel applications to hardware accelerators and achieve good performance. In addition, we designed a unified language that can be mapped to both software and hardware, enabling programmers to create parallel software and parallel accelerators in a unified framework. The third part of the thesis proposes a framework that enables accelerators to perform intelligent dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) to achieve good energy-efficiency for interactive and real-time applications. The framework combines program analysis and machine learning to train predictors that can accurately predict the computation time needed for each job, and adjust the DVFS levels to reduce the energy consumption.		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:25Z (GMT).

This study investigated the impact of ash leachate generated from fires on the bank filtration removal of parasites including Cryptosporidium parvum. The transport of C. parvum, surrogate latex microspheres, and E. coli through packed sediment columns was examined in the presence of wildfire ash leachate. Increases in leachate concentration resulted in increased retention, despite theoretical predictions of high dissolved organic carbon and phosphate concentrations in leachate, predicting increased transport. In these studies, E.coli was retained more than C. parvum oocysts, possibly due to the smaller size and elongated shape of the bacteria. When columns were flushed first with ash leachate and parasites were retained, but then washed with river water, at least 10% of the parasites were transported. Ash leachate seems to favor retention of pathogens and suggests that fire may not be problematic for bank filtration systems.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:25Z (GMT).

This dissertation considers the ways in which two modes of televisual meaning-making, namely crime dramas and reality television, can work against that closure by providing models of feminine possibility and occupation.  Viewers can pursue the openness of imaginative occupying by reading with the grain of the narratives, which teach viewers first how to understand the stories on the screen and then to understand the possibilities for navigating and ultimately challenging the power structures that marginalize and disadvantage certain bodies.  Detailed readings of Murder, She Wrote (CBS, 1984-1996); Person of Interest (CBS, 2011-2016); The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills (Bravo, 2010- ); Charlie‚Äôs Angels (ABC, 1976-1981); The Real World (MTV, 1992- ); Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (NBC, 1999- ); Perry Mason (CBS, 1957-1966); and How to Get Away With Murder (ABC, 2014- ) track the connections that these narratives make across a history of television and with other technological and social developments.  Stereotypically feminine modes of understanding and community-building like multitasking, talking or visiting, reflecting, and empathizing or imagining depth become the operative actions by which viewers might imagine the possibilities available to them and ultimately look beyond the constraints of a cultural machine that traditionally disempowers them.  By employing the sorts of simultaneous and imaginative thinking that helps the characters we see on the screen become successful, we can also imagine the spaces of the television industry and of a cultural machine as places that we can connect to and through.  The modes of making meaning that stories and characters model for the viewer become a methodology for creating, understanding, and representing significant depth in television programming.

One way of overcoming this is by infusing the drug directly into the diseased site in the brain using either a needle or a cannula, a technique known as convection-enhanced delivery (CED). CED uses a pressure gradient to disperse the drug farther than if the drug were dispersed solely by diffusion. However, once the drug has been injected into the brain, physicians lose the ability to control the spatial distribution of the drug. Ultrasound focused via time-reversal acoustics (TRA) has been shown to further increase the distribution volume of CED infusions, raising the possibility that TRA-focused ultrasound may be used to direct the distribution of substances infused into brain tissue. In this dissertation, ultrasound focused adjacent to the infusion site did not appear to affect the distribution of Evans blue‚Äìlabeled bovine serum albumin (EBA) in 0.2% wt/vol agarose gels or in vivo in the caudate putamen of rodent brains. Ultrasound focused at the site of infusion did not affect the distribution volumes of tracers when they were co-infused with microbubbles, but did significantly increase the distribution volume of EBA when it was co-infused with 20-nm, but not 40-nm, polystyrene particles. Results from a diffusion model suggest that ultrasound may have enhanced the convective phase rather than the diffusive phase of these infusions. Examination of rodent brain sections using fluorescence microscopy showed a distribution of EBA interspersed with regions of low Evans blue intensity that coincided with axon bundles, suggesting that the distribution of substances in the caudate putamen is not uniform even within seemingly homogeneous grey matter. This may partially account for the disappointing results from advanced CED clinical trials so far.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:27Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

As macroscopic properties of materials are closely tied to their microscopic structure, the ability to directly observe with atomic resolution can elucidate many questions that may otherwise remain enigmatic. In perovskite oxides, slight changes in structure or bonding environment can lead to drastic changes in electronic properties. In particular, when realized in thin film heterostructures, oxides have shown to exhibit various exotic functionalities that are not observed in their bulk constituents. To preserve these properties, controlling the quality of thin films and their interfaces is critical. Here, STEM in conjunction with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) is used to optimize the design and growth of oxide thin films. Furthermore, STEM-EELS is performed at cryogenic temperature to study low temperature phase transitions that occur in oxides. The employment of the water-soluble oxide Sr3Al2O6 can enable fabrication of freestanding oxide membranes decoupled from the substrate. However, its unique mechanical and chemical properties can also lead to instabilities during growth of other oxides atop. Atomic-resolution STEM-EELS reveals that the crystal structure of Sr3Al2O6, and therefore its physical properties, is fully disrupted due to a chemical reaction triggered by the subsequent growth of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3. However, with the insertion of an ultrathin SrTiO3 barrier layer, the inherent structure of Sr3Al2O6 can be preserved, thus enabling its wider application. In addition, results from STEM-EELS show the emergence of defects at the interfaces between Sr3Al2O6 and other oxide materials that lead to formation of a defect network. With this, cations are observed to diffuse out from the intended film region and to segregate at interfacial defects, degrading the film‚Äôs stoichiometry and its electronic properties. By suppressing the diffusion of cations, the film‚Äôs properties are restored. Superconductivity in ruthenates has gathered much interest. However, Sr2RuO4 is known to be a highly disorder-sensitive superconductor. Here, using annular bright-field (ABF) and annular dark-field (ADF) STEM, we probe both superconducting and non-superconducting Sr2RuO4 films. Surprisingly, the superconducting film is observed to have variations in the number of perovskite cells confined within the (Sr-O)2 rock-salt layers, which is also accompanied with the nucleation of vertical (Sr-O)2 layers. The non-superconducting film, on the other hand, exhibits a uniform Ruddlesden-Popper structure. This likely indicates the role of vertical (Sr-O)2 layers in effectively accommodating local non-stoichiometries in the film. Furthermore, in the related ruthenate family CaRuO3, it is observed that depositing these films under excess ruthenium is critical. Ruthenium deficiency during growth leads to nucleation of vertical (Ca-O)2 Ruddlesden-Popper faults. As excess ruthenium flow is allowed, stoichiometric CaRuO3 films are synthesized and are observed to grow at a tilted angle with respect to the underlying substrate. This tilt causes distortions of the oxygen octahedra in the CaRuO3 film which may affect the film‚Äôs properties. Room temperature measurement are important, however, a range of electronic and magnetic phases in oxides emerge at low temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that charge-ordering (CO) in Nd0.5Sr0.5MnO3 thin films can be revealed with atomic-resolution using cryogenic STEM-EELS. In addition to direct mapping of the lattice response in the CO state with STEM, EELS is used to elucidate the charge modulation structure. Existing models of checkerboard ordering are confirmed, albeit with partial charge segregation compared to the previously suggested full ionic picture.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:28Z (GMT).

Recently, it was reported that several members of the sirtuin family (Sirt1-7), the mammalian orthologs of the silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, play important roles in carcinogenesis. In mammals there are three mitochondrial sirtuins, SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5. Among these, SIRT5 is the only known enzyme that catalyzes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent demalonylation, desuccinylation and deglutarylation. SIRT5 impacts diverse metabolic pathways. One substrate of SIRT5 is carbamoyl phosphate synthase 1 (CPS1), an enzyme involved in the rate-limiting step of the urea cycle. By deacylating CPS1, SIRT5 promotes urea cycle function and clearance of toxic ammonia. Sirt5-deficient mice fail to up-regulate CPS1 activity and show elevated blood ammonia during fasting. SIRT5 regulates mitochondrial respiration by targeting glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH), isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). SIRT5 also controls glutamine metabolism by targeting glutaminase (GLS), and fatty acid metabolism by activating very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD), enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECHA) and 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Synthase 2 (HMGCS2). SIRT5 has also been implicated in regulating NADPH generation and redox potential by deglutarylating glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and desuccinylating superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1).        Recent studies revealed that SIRT5 knock-down in human breast and lung cancer cells inhibited their transformed properties, whereas it had no significant effect on the growth of normal cells. Furthermore, it has been shown that the expression levels of SIRT5 are increased in several human cancers, often due to gene amplification. We hypothesize that SIRT5 is required by cancer cells to regulate the post-translational modifications of key enzymes involved in cancer metabolism. This dissertation aims to (A) elucidate the role of SIRT5 in cancer by using both, in vitro and in vivo approaches, (B) identify targets for desuccinylation catalyzed by SIRT5 in cancer cells, (C) evaluate the impact of Sirt5 loss on the expression of genes that might be critical for tumor progression, and (D) test the effect of SIRT5 inhibition in tumor progression.  	To study the effect of Sirt5 deficiency on mammary tumorigenesis, we used MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice, a genetically engineered model in which the animals develop metastatic mammary adenocarcinoma. We tested how mammary tumor latency, multiplicity, size and histological grade are affected by Sirt5 loss, and found that Sirt5 knockout (Sirt5-/-) mice had delayed mammary tumor onset, significantly increased overall survival, and decreased incidence of lung metastasis as compared to controls. Thus, SIRT5 loss significantly reduced cancer cell proliferation in vitro and mammary tumor growth in vivo.  	 To extend our knowledge of the pro-tumorigenic roles of SIRT5, we used another in vivo model that recapitulates glutamine-dependency of human cancers. We used a genetic mouse model in which Sirt5 is knocked out and c-Myc is constitutively activated in B cells. Unexpectelly, Sirt5 loss in EŒº-Myc transgenic mice did not affect lymphoma incidence and mortality, even though it targets multiple key metabolic enzymes, suggesting that the pro-tumorigenic roles of SIRT5 are tissue or oncogene-specific. 	Immunoblotting for succinyl-lysine levels in mammary tumor tissues from Sirt5-/- PyMT and Sirt5+/+ PyMT mice revealed that there were several proteins with greatly increased succinylation in Sirt5-/- PyMT mammary tumors. To identify targets for desuccinylation catalyzed by SIRT5, we performed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis on tumor tissues from Sirt5-/- PyMT and Sirt5+/+ PyMT mice. We identified many metabolic enzymes that were highly succinylated in Sirt5-/- PyMT mammary tumors, many of which are known to plays a critical role in the metabolic reprograming of cancer cells.  	To investigate how Sirt5 loss affects gene expression, we performed a comparative analysis of expression profiles in mammary tumors from Sirt5+/+ PyMT and Sirt5-/- PyMT mice. We identified significant dysregulation of 129 genes involved in multiple cellular processes such as cellular metabolism, circadian clock, and inflammation. Among these dysregulated genes, serum amyloid A (Saa), a gene that encodes for an acute phase protein linked to inflammation, was significantly downregulated in Sirt5-/- PyMT mammary tumors. Increased levels of SAA have been linked to tumor pathogenesis and metastasis.  	In light of the tumor promoting activity of SIRT5 and the grossly normal phenotype of Sirt5-/- mice, we tested SIRT5-selective small molecule inhibitors as cancer therapeutics. Pharmacological inhibition of SIRT5 repressed the anchorage independent growth of cancer cells and suppressed tumor progression in vivo. Together, these data demonstrate the importance of SIRT5-regulated post-translational modification in cancer metabolism and highlight novel regulatory events that are important for cancer progression."		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:29Z (GMT).

The analysis is based on participant observation of public forums held in 2015 which discussed the contents of a draft version of the Land Law. This thesis makes three inter-related arguments: first, the Ecuadorian state is back through the enactment of participatory democracy, and the discursive practices around state-led food sovereignty projects, which ultimately aim to empower the state by increasing its control over land and agricultural production. Second, participants of the forums acknowledge the return of the state but also exert their expertise by questioning the very knowledge, authority, and expertise of state legislators. Third, political ethnography is key for understanding the porous relationships between civil-society and the state in Latin America, which is increasingly becoming fuzzy with social movement actors transitioning into state official roles in the past decade.

Seven years later, the majority of Americans do not know what ""CVE"" is and few programs exist at the local level. This project examines the U.S. approach to CVE and the challenges local stakeholders faced while attempting to design and implement ""community-led"" CVE programming. In examining these challenges, I explore why only some communities have responded to the federal government's call for action to design and implement CVE programming and created what I term CVE governance networks. I find that three factors -community stakeholder interest in CVE, capacity to mobilize and facilitation-explain the variation in mobilization at the local level in the United States. 	  However, the creation of a CVE governance network does not necessarily mean that the network will develop and implement CVE programs. Local community stakeholders face numerous challenges throughout the policymaking process, which ultimately hinders implementation efforts. Often, governance networks succumb to internal political conflicts that are fueled by stakeholder disagreements over how CVE programming should be implemented within their communities. Given this, I find that networks with a local leader who is able to both facilitate coordination and make final implementation decisions tend to be more successful in implementing collaborative programming. Evidence from interviews and surveys of stakeholders involved in the CVE policymaking process lends support for my theory of local level collaborative policymaking and reveals the intricacies of the CVE policymaking process."		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:30Z (GMT).

In order to be successful during pathogenesis, Pto must recognize when it enters the leaf apoplast and then regulate the appropriate genes. In bacteria, two-component systems (TCSs) commonly sense environmental changes and modulate gene regulation to suit that environment. The leaf apoplast is relatively abundant in Ca2+ in comparison to the leaf surface. The TCS, CvsSR, in Pto is a regulatory system that is induced by Ca2+ and regulates virulence of Pto in tomato and Arabidopsis. The global virulence regulators hrpR, hrpS, and hrpL are among the genes that CvsSR regulate. Its role in virulence is partially explained through its regulation of these genes and also through its regulation of the gene PSPTO_5255, which encodes a carbonic anhydrase. Deletion of PSPTO_5255 reduces virulence of Pto on tomato and also delays the hypersensitive response caused by Pto on Nicotiana benthamiana. PSPTO_5255 was a previously uncharacterized virulence gene in Pto and the mechanism by which it affects virulence is still unclear.  Bacteria may induce precipitation of calcium upon exposure to increases in external Ca2+ concentration. Several Pseudomonas species and strains induce precipitation of calcium phosphate in the external environment surrounding the bacterial colony. Calcium phosphate precipitation on the surface of bacterial cells was variable among Pseudomonas strains. Pto is among the strains that does not normally precipitate calcium phosphate on the surface of cells. Multiple genes are involved in Pto calcium phosphate precipitation, including ones that suppress surface-associated calcium phosphate precipitation in Pto. The genes cvsS and cvsR are among the genes that suppress surface-associated calcium phosphate precipitation in Pto. In the ‚àÜcvsS and ‚àÜcvsR strains, this process is partially dependent on the CvsSR regulated genes PSPTO_5255 and PSPTO_5256. Constitutive expression of PSPTO_5255 and PSPTO_5256 in the ‚àÜcvsS and ‚àÜcvsR strains suppress surface-associated calcium phosphate precipitation. This suggests that Pto utilizes secretion of bicarbonate or carbonic acid to keep calcium phosphate from accumulating on the surface of cells.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:31Z (GMT).

While it is desirable to solve this problem in minimum time, the non-completeness of the connectivity graph and the classification objectives do not allow for a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solution. Moreover, the TSP is known to be NP hard. Therefore, this thesis presents an approach for decomposing the UGV workspace based on the directional sensor FOV, line-of-sight visibility and obstacle map. By this approach, a connectivity graph with observation cells can be obtained and an optimal path can be computed via integer programming. Simulations conducted in Webots, a professional robot simulator that supports accurate simulation of rigid body dynamics and sensors with computer vision capability, demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach compared to the "nearest neighbor" methods and classical TSP formulations.		6/8/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:32Z (GMT).

Mellon Foundations Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship Program. In my first chapter I investigate school responses to incentives created by No Child Left Behind to alter special education placement, and use these responses as instruments to estimate the effect of special education placement. I use administrative data from the universe of North Carolina Public Schools and a difference-in-difference framework in which incentives are determined by the interactions between schools‚Äô expectations about subgroup performance on the one hand and student performance and subgroup membership on the other. I find that schools use special education to target supports and services to students close to the passing threshold in reading when the school benefits from their passing. Schools also select the special education group to be higher performing when doing so benefits the school. Special education decreases attendance and has large negative effects on the math scores of some marginal students.  The second chapter explores the effect of time spent waiting for a Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) decision on health and well-being. Previous research has shown that SSDI in general, and wait time in particular, depresses labor market activity, but other effects are largely unexplored. I use administrative data from the Social Security Administration linked to the National Health Interview Survey, and use summary data to create instruments for wait time. A longer wait increases the number of conditions causing activity limitations and the likelihood of having current benefits at survey, and decreases the likelihood of seeking a reconsideration or having benefits terminated at survey.  The Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship Program (MMUFP) aims to increase the number of underrepresented minorities entering earning PhDs, with an eye to improving their representation in academia. The third chapter evaluates whether the MMUFP increased the number of PhDs achieved by underrepresented minority students (URMs) at participating undergraduate institutions. The chapter finds no evidence that participation in the program causes a statistically significant increase in the numbers of PhDs completed by URM students, and increases greater than about one PhD per institution per cohort lie outside a 95% confidence interval of the estimates.

However, food is not produced in a vacuum; farms are closely linked to surrounding environments, which can function as pathogen reservoirs as well as pathways for pathogen dispersal into fields. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the ecological processes that drive the presence, dispersal and persistence of bacterial pathogens in agricultural environments is essential for the development of adaptive approaches to fresh produce safety. In the studies presented here, we employed several approaches to investigate the ecological processes associated with pathogen dispersal in and contamination of produce production environments at multiple scales. Specifically, these studies investigated (i) spatial and temporal risk factors associated with L. monocytogenes isolation at the farm, field and sub-field levels, and (ii) factors associated with the transfer of generic E. coli from contaminated wildlife feces to and survival on individual, preharvest produce items. We observed that foodborne pathogens are not uniformly present in agricultural environments, and that specific spatial (e.g., proximity to pasture) and temporal (e.g., time between a rain event and harvest) factors were associated with an increased likelihood of pathogen detection. Using this information, we validated geospatial models that predict when and where pathogen contamination of produce production environments is likely to occur. We were also able to identify specific management practices that were associated with pathogen contamination of preharvest produce. For example, irrigation water was found to be a key pathway for pathogen dispersal in agricultural environments. The transfer of bacteria from in-field contamination sources, such as wildlife feces, to preharvest produce during irrigation was significantly associated with the distance between the produce and the feces. Following contamination, bacteria were able to survive on in-field produce for >10 days. Die-off observed over these 10 days followed a biphasic pattern with more rapid die-off immediately following contamination (i.e., 0-106 hours post-contamination). Overall the findings of the studies reported here provide key data that can be used to develop targeted strategies for reducing the likelihood of preharvest produce contamination.

While vegetative bacteria can be inactivated by traditional high temperature, short time (HTST) pasteurization, spores are not destroyed by this process. Instead, dairy producers can utilize nonthermal methods such as microfiltration and centrifugation to physically remove spores from raw milk. In this work, various factors impacting the efficacy of spore removal by these processing methods were investigated. Microfiltration (MF) is a membrane separation process that can remove spores from skim milk by size exclusion. In Chapter One, different pore size MF membranes were evaluated for their effectiveness in removing Bacillus licheniformis or Geobacillus sp. spores from milk. These spores have been frequently isolated from the farm, dairy processing environments, and in finished products. By decreasing membrane pore size from 1.4 ¬µm to 1.2 ¬µm, removal of B. licheniformis spores significantly increased, while near full removal of Geobacillus sp. spores was achieved with both membrane pore sizes. Investigation of cell size and surface properties determined that this difference in effectiveness was a function of both the spore size relative to membrane pore size, as well as differing hydrophobicity of the spores. In Chapter Two, a follow-up study was completed to determine the shelf-life of refrigerated milk produced using a combination 1.2 ¬µm MF and HTST pasteurization process compared to HTST pasteurization or 1.2 ¬µm MF alone. The MF-HTST process achieved the longest microbial shelf-life of at least 98 days. However, the findings demonstrated that while increased bacterial removal can result in a significantly increased microbial shelf-life, this may not translate in an equally long proteolytic shelf-life, which is limited by off-flavors due to casein degradation.  MF processing is limited to skim milk due to the overlap of milk fat globule sizes with bacterial cell size, and the potential for membrane fouling by fat globules. Therefore, research on processing methods to remove spores from whole milk are of additional importance to the dairy industry. One such example is bactofugation, a specialized centrifugation process designed to decrease the microbial load of milk that is suitable for skim or whole milk. Chapter Three describes a study that was completed in a NY State dairy plant to evaluate the effectiveness of bactofugation on microbial removal from milk, and to provide a direct comparison of a fluid milk process with and without a bactofuge. In considering the growing interest of bactofugation in the dairy industry, yet the little available data on the impact of certain processing parameters, the effect of centrifugal force and temperature on spore removal was studied using a laboratory centrifuge, as described in Chapter Four. Centrifugation again decreased the concentration of bacteria in the skim portion. Bacterial concentration was observed in the cream fraction likely due to cold agglutination of fat globules by immunoglobulins present in the raw milk. Overall, the effectiveness of bacterial removal from skim milk was primarily affected by centrifugation temperature, rather than centrifugation speed.  Together, this work provides useful information about the effectiveness of nonthermal processing alternatives in removing spores from milk. This in turn can lead to the production of higher quality milk, increasing the shelf-life and marketability of US dairy products.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:34Z (GMT).

Considerable progress has been made in uncovering genes involved in the biosynthesis of cuticular components; however, much remains to be learnt about the relationship between cuticle composition, structure and function. In particular, a longstanding question is the identity of the factors underlying cuticle water permeance and its wide variation across species. The research presented here leveraged the cuticle diversity found amongst domesticated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cultivars and their wild relatives to investigate the associations between different cuticle properties, as well as the genetic underpinnings of their variation. Through the use of homology analysis, genetic mapping and transcriptomics, S. lycopersicum was compared with the wild species S. pennellii and S. neorickii to identify the genetic differences responsible for their distinct cuticle properties. Furthermore drought stress was shown to alter the composition of the fruit cuticles of each of these species differently, but did not substantially alter the water permeance values of any of them. Characterization of S. lycopersicum cultivars with particularly high or low fruit transpiration rates revealed that the cuticular water permeance was mainly a product of the abundance of trichome-associated transcuticular pores. This body of work advances our understanding of the mechanisms by which cuticle properties are determined and identifies possible avenues for breeding or engineering to improve fruit shelf life.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:35Z (GMT).

For example, making decisions based on machine learning models often leads to multi-stage inference problems where probabilistic models learned from data are embedded as first-stage subproblems within a global second-stage problem for decision-making. Multi-agent reasoning also involves multi-stage inference, since the reasoning of any given agent has to incorporate the goals of the other agents. As a result, the decision processes of the other agents are embedded as first-stage subproblems within the overall decision-making problem of that agent. With formal complexities beyond NP, multi-stage inference problems are often highly intractable. In this thesis, I introduce a novel computational framework, based on embeddings, to tackle multi-stage inference problems. Our embedding technique approximates the intractable sub-problems of a multi-stage inference problem through a series of novel representations. We then embed these representations into the global problem, effectively reducing a multi-stage inference to a single-stage inference. As one example, I present a novel way to encode the reward allocation problem for a two-stage organizer--agent game as a single-stage optimization. The encoding embeds an approximation of the agents' decision-making process into the organizer's problem in the form of linear constraints. We apply this methodology to eBird, a well-established citizen-science program for collecting bird observations, in a game called Avicaching. Our AI-based reward allocation was shown to be highly effective, surpassing the expectations of the eBird organizers and bird conservation experts. As another example, I present a novel constant approximation algorithm to solve stochastic optimization problems which identify the optimal policy that maximizes the expectation of a stochastic objective. To tackle this problem, I propose the embedding of its intractable counting subproblems as queries to NP oracles subject to additional XOR constraints. As a result, the entire problem is encoded as a single NP-equivalent optimization. This approach outperforms state-of-the-art solvers based on variational inference and MCMC sampling, on probabilistic inference benchmarks, deep learning applications, and a novel decision-making application in network design for wildlife conservation. I also apply the embedding technique to automated reasoning and machine learning for dimensionality reduction in scientific discovery. As one example, I propose the use of embeddings based on Fourier analysis as a compact representation of high-dimensional probability distributions. As a second example,  I show how human computation, crowdsourcing, and parallel computation can identify key backdoor information, thereby drastically reducing the computation time from days to minutes in a dimensionality reduction application with complex physical constraints. Our novel integration of reasoning and learning has led to the discovery of new solar light absorbers by solving a dimensionality reduction problem to characterize the crystal structure of metal oxide materials using X-ray diffraction data.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:36Z (GMT).

The first involves features that develop before the liner‚Äôs surface ionizes and turns into plasma. The second concerns the formation of a helical structure in the liner when an external axial magnetic field is applied throughout the liner.  We experimentally investigated micrometer scale features that develop in thin metallic liners driven by the 1 MA COBRA pulsed power machine. These features are associated in the literature with possible non-ionized matter electrothermal and electrochoric instabilities [Phys. Plasmas 22, 102701 (2015)]. To study the development of the micrometer structure, we first needed to optimize the X-pinch X-ray diagnostic for such high-resolution measurements in cylindrical liner experiments. We show images from two types of detectors, the SR image plate and the DR-50 film, demonstrating that using film is critical for the detection of the micrometer structure in thin Ti, Ni and Cu liners. Using that X-pinch diagnostic, we first examined the 17 - 25 ¬µm features that develop in 16 ¬µm thick Al liners without dielectric coatings. Results of areal density variation and the dominant wavelength of these features are compared with computer simulations using an extended MHD computational model with recently implemented Al Equation-of-State and resistivity models. Experimental results obtained with Al, Ni, Cu and Ti show the average feature size of the perturbation decreases in these materials in the order given. When applying a dielectric coating at the surface of the material, we demonstrate that expansion inhibition correlates with significantly reduced areal density variation and size of perturbations. We additionally show evidence that the insulator is predominantly heated by conduction, as opposed to radiation. Finally, we show that ingrained structure in our liner material a) influences the small scale features‚Äô structure, changing the azimuthal correlation of the features from highly to weakly correlated depending on the orientation of current flow with respect to the material‚Äôs ingrained pattern and b) changes the density perturbation amplitude quantitatively. Beyond micrometer scale features, we also investigated the formation of a 600-750 ¬µm wavelength helical pattern in the liner when viewed with extreme ultraviolet self-emission imaging on COBRA. The magnetic field in these experiments was created using either twisted return current wires positioned close to the liner, generating a time-varying Bz, or a Helmholtz coil, generating a steadystate Bz. We show that an upward external axial magnetic field generates a lefthanded twist of the helical pattern and a downward field a right-handed twist. We further show that the helix angle does not correspond to Bz-applied/BŒ∏(t) , where BŒ∏(t) is the expected BŒ∏ at the time of measurement, and briefly present a few proposed explanations for the behavior. We conclude that section by proposing an evidence-based explanation as to why the self-emission diagnostics detect any pattern at all, whether helical or axial.

One prominent feature of Mtb infection is the extensive reprogramming of host environment at the site of infection. In this dissertation, we have taken two different approaches to target immune environment, with the hope to perturb Mtb infection. First, we report that inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) enhances the in vivo potency of the frontline TB drugs isoniazid and rifampicin. MMPs expression is markedly upregulated in human tuberculosis (TB) granulomas and murine infection models. Inhibition of MMP activity leads to an increase in pericyte-covered blood vessel numbers and appears to stabilize the integrity of the infected lung tissue. In treated mice, we observe an increased delivery and/or retention of Evans Blue dye and frontline TB drugs in the infected lungs, resulting in enhanced drug efficacy. These findings indicate that targeting Mtb-induced host tissue remodeling can increase therapeutic efficacy and could enhance the effectiveness of current drug regimens. Second, we show that synthetic mRNA encoding CCL2 or CCL3 are able to recruit certain populations of monocyte in a non-inflammatory manner. These recruited monocytes stay in a neutral, non-programmed state, exhibiting neither bactericidal nor tissue-repairing phenotypes. Additional Ifn-ÔÅß mRNA or Il-4 mRNA can polarize these cells to different phenotypes. Furthermore, the monocytes recruited by Ccl3 and Ifn-ÔÅß mRNA were able to launch the most rapid and strongest superoxide burst compared to other mRNA combinations.  These findings demonstrate a synthetic mRNA based immune-modulation scheme that allows recruitment and modification of specific immune cell populations in vivo, which can impact tuberculosis progression.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:39Z (GMT).

Great efforts have been spent to study the mechanisms underlying the aging process, with the ultimate goal of developing effective interventions to delay the onset of aging and to extend lifespan. Mitochondria, more than just being the powerhouses of the cell, are involved in a wide range of cellular and metabolic processes. Multiple lines of evidence have suggested that mitochondria play a vital role in the process of aging. Therefore, my research aims to investigate the effect of both dietary supplements and mitochondrial DNA content on lifespan.  Chapter one reviews the contemporary knowledge of mitochondrial DNA genetics and the implication of mitochondrial dysfunction in human diseases. It also summarizes the interaction between mitochondria and different dietary components or dietary patterns. I want to emphasize the importance of investigating the role of mitochondria in the development of complex diseases and to suggest future directions in identifying nutritional interventions to restore mitochondrial functions.  Chapter two and Chapter three describe the discoveries of two compounds that extend the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster. The first one is konjac glucomannan hydrolysate, which can promote longevity in both genders across different genetic backgrounds, and regardless of mating status. By investigating the potential underlying mechanisms, we found it extends the lifespan through promoting the growth of gut microbiome and preserving the intestinal proliferative homeostasis. The second compound is oligofructose, the hydrolyzed form of inulin. It can also prolong the lifespan but is restricted to specific genetic backgrounds and mating status. Revealed by the transcriptome analysis, it is very likely that it extends lifespan through the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration and suppression of stress signaling pathways.  Chapter four describes an exploratory project on the relationship between mitochondrial DNA content and lifespan in both normal and stress conditions. By implementing both survival test and transcriptome analysis, we found a possible connection between mtDNA copy number and the lifespan in male flies through regulation of fertility.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:41Z (GMT).

While earthquake-generated tsunamis are catastrophes on a more global scale, landslide-generated tsunamis tend to cause extreme local damage. Acknowledging the great uncertainty in the motion and the properties of real tsunamigenic landslides, and the challenges in assuming a complex multiphysics landslide model given the uncertainty, we focus on understanding the fundamental mechanics of the wave generation process. The main objectives of this study are to determine the most computationally efficient wave model that can be used to simulate the wave generation process due to a submarine landslide, and to construct a closed-form wave generation model that requires no computation. New analytical solutions were derived for landslide-generated tsunamis in idealized scenarios. Analytical solutions not only provide the scaling relations between a submarine landslide and the resulting tsunami, but also reveal that the volume of a landslide, as opposed to its exact shape, has the greatest impact on the leading tsunami wave generated by the landslide. Therefore, in modeling, it is more important to match the landslide volume than to match the exact landslide shape.  Numerical solvers based on long-wave equations were constructed to complement the analytical solutions. By comparing the numerical results based on different long-wave equations, nonlinear effects and frequency dispersion effects were examined separately. Using the knowledge gained from both analytical solutions and numerical simulations, we proposed criteria to determine whether nonlinearity is important and whether frequency dispersion is important in a landslide tsunami problem, and therefore the appropriate wave generation model to use.  Lastly, combining the findings of this study, we constructed a closed-form landslide tsunami generation model. As a function of relevant input parameters, the model outputs a tsunami wave profile due to a submarine landslide. In contrast to all existing closed-form landslide tsunami generation models, the new model is based on the newly derived analytical solutions, and provides information on not only the maximum wave height, but also the complete free surface profile, the flow velocity, and the duration of the wave generation stage. The new model was shown to be an improvement over a commonly used empirical model.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:42Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The first chapter studies on the impact of cost of capital on corporate investment and financing decisions. Previous literature shows that the implied cost of capital (ICC) has a negative effect on investment, while the factor model-based estimates have positive effects on investment. Our paper documents that these alternative cost-of-equity proxies also have opposite effects on equity issuance. We show that the ICC has negative effects on investment and equity issuance by capturing the firm-specific discount rate news, whereas the factor model-based estimates have positive effects on these decisions by capturing the market-wide cash flow news. Thus, the opposite effects of the ICC and factor-model based estimates can be explained by their distinctive information contents. In the second chapter, I evaluate the economic consequences of advisory misconduct by estimating the effect of publicly disclosed regulatory actions of mutual fund advisors on fund flows. Based on a broad set of misconduct events from 2000-2013, I find a 5% reduction in fund flows to malfeasant advisors in one year following the misconduct. Further analysis using the 2001 SEC electronic filing mandate as a positive shock to misconduct transparency corroborates these results. In order to mitigate the negative impact on flows, mutual fund companies tend to raise marketing expenditures, reduce contractual incentives and relax investment restrictions in subsequent years. Moreover, advisory misconduct adversely affects advising relationships and advisor survival. My findings highlight the significant impact of misconduct on fund flows and advisory contracting in the mutual fund industry. In the last chapter, we evaluate the effectiveness of Interfund Lending Programs for both borrowing and lending funds in fund families. We find strong support for the positive effect for borrowing funds. Under extreme distress ILP-funds have 0.32% higher returns than non-ILP funds in the following week. Sub-sample analysis shows that the positive effect is mainly driven by equity and municipal funds, and the effect is more pronounced when funds hold illiquid assets, when external funding cost is high, and when fund families are more diversified in styles. Moreover, Interfund Lending Programs facilitate liquidity management and reduce external borrowing activities. But we find limited evidence concerning the effectiveness for lending funds. Taken together, our results suggest that Interfund Lending Programs play a crucial part as internal capital market in fund families.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:43Z (GMT).

Arising from this density is the frequent contact between various socioeconomic actors, which provides for the means of social interactions as well as productivity gains accrued through agglomeration economies. This collection of papers begins on the premise that social interactions underlie economic forces, which constitute the ingredients of the complex system that is the urban economy, jointly determining the outcome of cities as a whole. With such a view of the urban economy, this dissertation attempts to answer a series of key questions regarding the interface between social interactions, agglomeration economies, new firm formation, and economic growth. The first paper proposes an agent-based model of social network formation that explicitly considers space and untangles the complex relationship between social interaction dynamics and inequalities in socioeconomic resources. The second paper builds upon the insight that social interactions and economic outcomes are related and addresses the question of how social interactions and agglomeration economies jointly determine new firm formation in cities. Finally, the last paper attempts to answer the critical question of how urban economies should grow, under the premise that growth takes place through changes in industrial structure brought about by entrepreneurship in particular industries. Knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of social interactions, and how such interactions bring about new firm formation and economic growth provides for both a theoretical and empirical framework for which planning interventions can be made within the realm of community and economic development. The findings could be used to assist planners in better understanding the workings of the urban economy and inform decision making that aims to promote sustained economic growth.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:44Z (GMT).

Specifically, we identify phenomenology at or near a synchronization threshold in four distinct cases. First, we identify a novel spatiotemporal pattern in the two-dimensional Kuramoto lattice with periodic boundary conditions. This pattern appears as a two-armed rotating spiral in the spatial variation of the oscillators' instantaneous frequencies; hence the name ``frequency spirals.'' Second, we look at a large (but finite) number N of globally coupled oscillators in the special case where the natural frequencies are evenly spaced on a given interval. With these conditions, a leading order correction to the locking threshold is derivable, and scales according to N^{-3/2}. Thirdly, we do a case study on how topology can affect synchronization by comparing the locking threshold for a ring and chain of oscillators. Given identical initial phases and random natural frequencies, the ratio of locking thresholds is given upper and lower bounds which depend only on the shape of the coupling function. Finally, we examine a population of oscillators with random coupling strengths distributed across zero. A quarter century ago, a ``volcano transition'' was identified in such a model, but by using a particular coupling matrix construction, we present the first results analytically characterizing the transition point.

While these calendars are fluid and adaptable by nature, outside forces have caused many of them to be diminished in their usability. In Sary Mogol, a community located in the Pamir-Alai Mountain Range in Kyrgyzstan, these forces have taken the form of Soviet era restructuring and collectivization, resulting in discontinuity of knowledge transfer. Climate change is an additional pressure on this community which relies heavily on pastoralism and crop production. This thesis takes a holistic approach in addressing the question of if the revitalization of ecological calendars can assist communities facing the pressures of climate change, through the synthesis of an ecological calendar of Sary Mogol and an analysis of the influence of the nearby coal mine and other pressures.

Igneous suites of late Oligocene (25-27 Ma) and early Miocene (19-20 Ma) age are defined through zircon U-Pb geochronology and whole-rock geochemistry. Both suites exhibit high-K calc-alkaline geochemistry, but the early Miocene porphyries have a shoshonitic affinity. Normalized rare earth element patterns indicate that the late Oligocene suite was influenced by plagioclase fractionation, whereas amphibole-garnet fractionation was important during the early Miocene event.  The location and morphology of the sulfide deposits are controlled by a preexisting ductile structural architecture with ductile to brittle faults interacting with chemically reactive marble host rocks. The sulfide orebodies at the Olympias and Madem Lakkos deposits resulted from the intersection of ductile fabrics and fold hinges with extensional mylonites and semi-brittle shear zones. Ore lenses at the Mavres Petres deposit are restricted to fault-imbricated marbles contained within the Stratoni fault zone. Hydrothermal alteration associated with sulfide deposition occurred between 24 Ma and 22 Ma based on 40Ar-39Ar muscovite ages. Kinematic fault-slip analysis and field relationships suggest that sulfide mineralization within the Stratoni fault zone was controlled by north-south extension, whereas a younger phase of mineralization was influenced by east-west extension. The early Miocene Skouries porphyry stock, hosted by a folded gneiss-schist sequence, was localized within the steeply dipping limb of a preexisting district-scale antiform. Northeast-striking porphyry dikes and sheeted veins within the stock indicate that Au-Cu mineralization occurred in response to northwest-southeast directed extension.  Structural crosscutting relationships, geochronological ages, carbon-oxygen isotopes, fluid inclusions, and metal distribution patterns suggest that the late Oligocene hydrothermal system within the Stratoni fault zone was centered to the southeast of the Madem Lakkos deposit with an isolated hydrothermal system located to the east of the Olympias deposit. Porphyry Au-Cu mineralization culminated about 4 m.y. later, but was restricted to the Skouries stock. Polymetallic carbonate replacement sulfide and porphyry Au-Cu ore formation corresponds to late Oligocene and early Miocene magmatic events that manifested within the back arc environment in a post-collisional tectonic setting.

Unlike traditional teams with a defined set of employees, today‚Äôs work teams exhibit great fluidity: workers now move across the boundaries more freely and frequently. Despite capturing the recent interest of researchers, our understanding of dynamic team membership and its implications remains limited. To fill the void in the existing literature, this study examined an important aspect of membership change (i.e., predictability) that may influence affective emergent states (i.e., team potency and cohesion) and ultimately team effectiveness. This study also examined team role structure as a team contextual factor that shapes the impact of predictable membership change. The results of a laboratory experiment revealed that the predictability of member change is positively associated with team potency after the change. Change predictability is also positively related with team cohesion after the change, but only when the roles in the focal team are undifferentiated. In addition, the results showed that the group emergent states that occur after membership change have unique contributions on team effectiveness over and above the effects of team task-coordination process.		6/8/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:50Z (GMT).

They have found wide applicability in personalized medicine, time series analysis, prediction tasks in the physical sciences, and recently blackbox optimization. Their success is in large part due to two fundamental advantages they enjoy over many other models. First, they provide convenient and often well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Machine learning models make mistakes, and by offering users full probabilistic predictions, Gaussian processes allow for more informed decision making in the face of uncertainty. Second, they allow users to encode and incorporate prior knowledge about their modelling task through the use of flexible and composable covariance functions or kernels. This aspect of Gaussian processes is particularly critical when faced with functions that are expensive or burdensome to evaluate, as they allow users to develop models that will generalize even with very limited data‚Äìin some cases, even before the first training example is collected. Despite these two clear advantages, some of the most popular applications of Gaussian processes have focused on exploiting the first advantage of GPs, and very little on exploiting the latter. As an example, in Bayesian optimization, off-the-shelf implementations often use the most generic and flexible covariance functions available. While a priori this ensures the generality of Bayesian optimization, it can significantly increase the number of function evaluations requredto perform optimization. In this thesis, we will demonstrate by way of application that the second advantage can be just as critical as the first. By leveraging expert medical knowledge, we develop a GP model that exploits basic facts about human hearing to dramatically improve both the quality and speed of modern audiometric testing. By automatically discovering independence structure in an objective function, we can leverage recent work on additive structure in Bayesian optimization to achieve exponentially lower sample complexities. Finally, by exploiting the product structure inherent to the RBF kernel‚Äìarguably the most common covariance function in usage‚Äìwe will develop approximations for the GP marginal log likelihood that result in exponential improvement to the running time complexity of Gaussian process inference compared to existing inducing point methods, resulting in the fastest asymptotic time complexity for training we are aware of.

Kenkel, Donald S.||Lovenheim, Michael F.	2018-10-22T17:24:51Z			5/30/18		This dissertation is comprised of three essays, each examining a different topic in health economics. In Chapter 1, I investigate ex ante moral hazard from health insurance, or the effect of insurance on risky behaviors. Specifically, I examine risky sex, a behavior with quick, meaningful consequences. I exploit the requirement insurance cover prescription contraception without cost-sharing. Since this policy affects a small aspect of insurance, I isolate the effect on behavior. Using pre-policy insured rates as a measure of treatment intensity, I find insurance decreases prevention (condom sales) and increases sexually transmitted infections (STIs). To determine insurance‚Äôs overall effect, I exploit the requirement insurance cover young adult children. I find the protective effect of insurance on STIs more than compensates for the reduction in prevention. In Chapter 2, I test whether weight impacts mental health. Both average body mass index (BMI) and rates of depression increased over the past several decades; however, scant research has investigated if the correlation between weight and depression reflects a causal effect. Using genetic variation in obesity predisposition as an instrument, I determine the impact of BMI on suicidality and depression. I find BMI impacts suicidal ideation but not other measures of mental health. This effect on suicidal ideation is concentrated in white women. One mechanism through which weight affects mental health is social stigma. In Chapter 3, I investigate the effect of financial aid on health, specifically BMI and general self-report health. Aid lowers the cost of college, which increases college-going. However, there is little evidence on the long-run impact of aid on health. I exploit a 1981 shock in Social Security benefits to test the effect of aid on health. Minor children of retired or disabled Social Security beneficiaries and children with deceased parents are eligible for their own benefits, and before 1981 these children could receiving benefits conditional on college enrollment. Using difference-in-differences, I show benefits for college students reduced women‚Äôs BMI and improved general health, but had no effect on men. I also find that aid improved educational attainment for beneficiaries, which is a plausible mechanism between aid and health.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:51Z (GMT).

A complete quantum description of such events is unfortunately intractable, but recent simulations show great promise in approximately but accurately modeling nonadiabatic systems. Perhaps the first step towards modeling these systems is the proper description of the relevant electronic states involved. We discuss two specific systems in which these states have been calculated, allowing for accurate dynamical simulations to be carried out. The first system described here is a model for intramolecular singlet fission in bipentacenes. Singlet fission, the process by which photoexcited singlet excitons spontaneously split into two lower energy triplet excitons, has received much attention as a promising avenue towards increasing solar cell efficiency. Recently, the blueprint for controlled synthesis of acene dimers has been utilized to create chromophores exhibiting efficient singlet fission, rivaling that of the best crystalline systems. Examining a specific dimer system (2,2-bipentacene), we show that intramolecular singlet fission proceeds nonadiabtically through an avoided crossing between single and multiexcitonic states. Subsequent dynamic calculations reveal singlet fission occurring on ultrafast timescales in agreement with experiment, supporting the proposed mechanism. Bipentacenes are not only interesting for their singlet fission capabilities, but also for their unusual spectral features in the visible region. Depending on bonding geometries, the spectrum of bipentacenes can be significantly altered (a second absorption peak appears in the visible) from that of the monomer. Despite first being observed in 1948, this spectral feature has not been properly described. We algebraically detail the origin of this spectral perturbation and give simple design principles for oligoacenes backed by intuitive molecular orbital arguments. Finally, we discuss a model for energy transfer between diatomics and metal surfaces. Despite being extensively studied experimentally, an adequate theoretical model, accurate across all experimental regimes, has not emerged. Exploiting the simplicity of a Schmidt decomposition of the single particle states of the Newns Hamiltonian, we show how intuitive local states can be constructed and utilized in dynamic calculations.

In high signal to noise images sub-picometer localization precision is achievable. Recent work has used ABF-STEM to measure oxygen displacements in complex oxides heterostructures, with intent of showing ferromagnetic and multiferroic properties. However, previous work on the accuracy of ABFSTGEM imaging has shown that when a sample is tilted by 6 mrad relative to the electron beam, it creates artificial displacements of 11.9 pm between oxygen and cation columns. Artifacts of this magnitude make picometer-scale measurements of oxygen displacements impossible. However, use of Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction (CBED) can aid sample alignment in the STEM and mistilts can typically be reduced to approximately 1 mrad or better. Thus, there remains an open question as to what kinds of tilt-induced artifacts exist at sample tilts expected in experimental ABF-STEM. In order to quantify the effects of a sample tilt of 1 mrad, I performed multislice image simulations on cubic SrTiO3 over a range of thicknesses from one atomic layer to just over 30 nm. I found that even with only 1 mrad of tilt, artificial displacements so large as 11:8pm between titanium/oxygen and oxygen columns and 4.2 pm between strontium and titanium/oxygen columns are present in ABF-STEM images. I further found that these displacements are not present in HAADF-STEM images, as the displacement between strontium and titanium/oxygen columns was below 0.2 pm at 1 mrad of sample tilt and less than 1.5 pm at sample tilts up to 10 mrad. Because tilts of this magnitude are difficult to control for experimentally, the apparent location of atomic positions in ABF-STEM images may not accurately reflect true atomic structure and measurements of picometer-scale oxygen distortions in complex oxides may not be possible unless sample tilt is carefully controlled.

Chau, Ho Yan	2018-10-22T17:24:53Z	2018-10-22T17:24:53Z		5/30/18		By conservative census estimates, roughly half of the settlements in India that are urban in nature are governed by rural governance forms instead of urban ones. This paper investigates whether this governance mismatch is associated with the development of settlements. I first empirically explore whether differences exist between rural-governed and urban-governed urban settlements on average, and on finding such differences, I explore the causal effect of urban governance forms, and find that they appear to be broadly associated with better levels of high spillover development indicators. The effect on low spillover development indicators is negative or mixed. The negative association with low spillover indicators need not, however, be indicative of a negative phenomenon for development overall. The results suggest that there is a case to convert rural governance forms in urban settlements to urban governance forms, and I conclude by exploring the political economy of such conversions.

The downstream estuary in Mexico has undergone habitat change as a consequence; however, a paucity of pre-impact data has made it challenging to assess the full scope of change. Fortunately, along the shoreline in the estuary there are accumulations of clam and snail shells that predate dam construction and can provide an invaluable perspective on past community dynamics in the molluscan community. Shell accumulations in the estuary were sampled during 2013 and 2014 at three sites along the north-south salinity gradient that existed prior to upstream water diversions. The living community was sampled during 2014 at the northern-most of these sites, which corresponds to the most estuarine environment from the past. In the following five chapters, a variety of analytical methods are applied to different subsets of the samples to assess change at multiple levels of the ecological hierarchy. Major results from these chapters include: (1) identification of a new predatory snail species in the estuary; (2) evidence suggesting decreases in predator populations in the estuary due to reduction in prey availability; (3) documentation of population decreases in species with preferences for low-salinity conditions and population increases for species with preferences for high-salinity conditions; (4) increases in community evenness and richness in the post-impact community; (5) evidence suggesting a shift in the processes controlling community assembly from environmental preference and dispersal capacity to competition-colonization tradeoff; and, (6) a reduction in carbon emissions from the estuary due to decreases in the clam population. Restoration efforts are ongoing in the Colorado River estuary under multiple binational agreements between the United States and Mexico. The results presented here represent baseline data that can be used to evaluate the success of those efforts and to inform the best strategies for restoration success. Counterintuitive as it may seem, restoration success likely means a reduction in the number of species living in the estuary and an increase in estuarine carbon emissions.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:54Z (GMT).

The first two essays are in the context of National Employment Guarantee Schemes (thereafter, NREGA) in India. In the first one, I study whether existing inequality hinders the implementations of NREGA, using district-level data on land ownership distribution and the implementations of NREGA. To address potential endogeneity issues, I leverage a historical institution in India, the land revenue collection system established by British colonial rulers during 1750-1861, to construct an instrumental variable for land inequality. Both OLS and instrumental variable results give robust evidence that the concentration of land ownership reduces public works provision. This relationship could be explained by the mechanism that public works schemes raise agricultural wages in the private labor market, thereby incentivizing big landlords to use their political power to oppose this program. This paper provides the first empirical evidence that the concentration of landownership, a proxy for political power, is a hurdle to providing public employment to the poor. In the second essay, I focus on the participants of NREGA and study the wage bargaining effect of participating in NREGA. Using a household level panel and a difference-in-differences framework, I find indirect evidence that participating in NREGA would increase the wage bargaining power for both participants themselves and for their spouses in the private labor market. The third essay focuses on a different social protection policy, minimum wage standards in China. I utilize a spatial lag methodology to study city level strategic interactions in setting and enforcing minimum wage standards during 2004-2012 in China. This analysis finds strong evidence of spatial interdependence in minimum wage standards and enforcement among main cities in China. If other cities decrease minimum wage standards by 1 RMB, the host city will decrease its standard by about 0.7-3.2 RMB. If the violation rate in other cities increases by 1 percentage point, the host city will respond by an increase of roughly 0.4-1.0 percentage points. These interactions suggest the need for policy coordination in labor regulation.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:54Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

A particularly interesting approach that has received increasing attention in the last couple of years is the formation of isoporous ultrafiltration membranes via the combination of block copolymer self-assembly (SA) with industrially proven non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS), a process now referred to as SNIPS. Triblock terpolymer based NIPS membranes have been investigated as a result of their improved mechanical toughness over the corresponding diblock copolymer derived membranes. To expand our understanding of this new area of block copolymer science and engineering, in this thesis SNIPS derived membranes were investigated based on triblock terpolymer poly(isoprene-b-styrene-b-4-vinylpyridine) (ISV). In a first effort, the effects of different casting parameters on membrane substructure morphology were studied. Experimental results elucidated a substructure morphology transition from finger-like to sponge-like through increasing dope concentration, evaporation time, and varying solvent compositions. Membranes with finger-like and sponge-like substructures were integrated with nylon supports to enhance mechanical stability for testing and handling and were evaluated for their hydraulic permeabilities. The effects of an important but often overlooked environmental casting parameter, relative humidity, were subsequently assessed on ISV membranes with a focus on membrane surface pore structure. Membranes cast at an optimized relative humidity of 40% were characterized by a high density of square packed surface pores. Additionally, precise control over the rate of permeation of a small molar mass solute was realized through variation in triblock terpolymer molar mass. After investigation of the SNIPS process and the associated molecular engineering of membrane properties via variation of process parameters and molecular architecture, new insights into the fabrication of asymmetric membranes were obtained from employing two chemically distinct triblock terpolymers in the dope used during the SNIPS process. Initial proof-of-principle experiments with mixtures of ISV and poly(isoprene-b-styrene-b-(dimethylamino)ethylmethacrylate) (ISA) demonstrated that the use of mixtures of chemically distinct triblock terpolymers enables the tailoring of membrane pore surface chemistries. This approach was subsequently used to improve membrane fouling properties by working with mixtures from ISV and terpolymer poly(isoprene-b-styrene-b-ethylene oxide) (ISO) which on its own is difficult to process into useful SNIPS membranes. Experimental results established that blended triblock terpolymer membranes exhibited a combination of properties intrinsic to the two specific block copolymers utilized. This opens access to designer membranes with desired pore surface chemical properties via a facile ‚Äúmix and match‚Äù approach. The results of this thesis taken together highlight the tremendous potential of SNIPS derived membranes to become the basis for next generation ultrafiltration technologies for applications in areas as diverse as biopharmaceutical separations, virus filtration, and drug delivery.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:55Z (GMT).

On its face, this question seems absurd because these notions of similarity are impossible to characterize in meaningful ways. Our work explores what happens when we can embrace this ambiguity. We use new kinds of semi-supervision to learn abstract, intuitive notions of perceptual similarity when labels or dense similarity measures are not available. Before we can learn about perceptual similarity, we must first show how to capture intuitive notions of similarity from humans in an efficient and principled way that makes as few assumptions as possible about the data structure. Then, we outline ways to combine expensive human expertise with dense machine kernels to ease the human annotation burden. Finally, we will discuss our work on creating a large-scale dataset of artwork that the research community can use to explore these ideas.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:55Z (GMT).

We define two canonical maps $\, \Tr_{\g}(\fra):\, \hc_{\bullet}^{(r)}(\fra) \to \h_{\bullet}[\drep_{\g}(\fra)]^G $ and $ \Phi_{\g}(\fra):\,\h_{\bullet}[\drep_{\g}(\fra)]^G  \to \h_{\bullet}[\drep_{\frh}(\fra)]^{\bW}  $,  called the Drinfeld trace and the derived Harish-Chandra homomorphism, respectively. The Drinfeld trace is defined on the $r$-th Hodge component of the cyclic homology of the universal enveloping algebra $\cU\fra $ of the Lie algebra $ \fra $  and depends on the choice of a $G$-invariant polynomial $ P \in \sym^r(\g^*)^G $ on the Lie algebra $ \g$. The Harish Chandra  homomorphism $ \Phi_{\g}(\fra) $ is a graded algebra homomorphism extending to  representation homology the natural restriction map  $\, k[\rep_{\g}(\fra)]^G \to k[\rep_{\frh}(\fra)]^{\bW} $, where $ \frh \subset \g $ is a Cartan subalgebra of $ \g $ and $ {\bW} $ is the associated Weyl group. We give general formulas for these maps in terms of  Chern--Simons forms. As a consequence, we show that, if $ \fra $ is an abelian Lie algebra, the composite map $ \Phi_{\g}(\fra) \circ \Tr_{\g}(\fra) $ is given by a canonical differential operator defined on differential forms on $ A = \sym(\fra) $ and depending  only on the Cartan data $ (\frh, {\bW}, P) $, where $ P \in \sym(\frh^*)^{\bW} $.  We derive a combinatorial formula for this operator that plays a key role in  the study of derived commuting schemes in \cite{BFPRW17a}.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:24:56Z (GMT).

Lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS)-mediated enolizations are moderately Z-selective in neat tetrahydrofuran (THF) and E-selective in 2.0 M THF/hexane. The results of NMR spectroscopy show the resulting enolates to be statistically distributed ensembles of E,E-, E,Z-, and Z,Z-enolate dimers with subunits that reflect the selectivities. The results of rate studies trace the preference for E and Z isomers to tetrasolvated- and pentasolvated-monomer-based transition structures, respectively. Enolization using LiHMDS in N,N-dimethylethylamine or triethylamine in toluene affords a 65:1 mixture of LiHMDS‚àílithium enolate mixed dimers containing E and Z isomers, respectively. Spectroscopic studies show that condition-dependent complexation of ketone to LiHMDS occurs in trialkylamine/toluene. Rate data attribute the high selectivity exclusively to monosolvated-dimer-based transition structures. Rate and mechanistic studies of ortholithiations by lithium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine focus on four arenes: 1,4-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene, 1,3-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene, 1,3-dimethoxybenzene, and 4,4-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2-oxazoline. Metalations occur via substrate-dependent combinations of monosolvated monomer, disolvated monomer, and tetrasolvated dimer (triple ions). Density functional theory computational studies augment the experimental data. We discuss the challenges presented by shifting dimer‚Äìmonomer proportions in determining the observable reaction orders and our mathematical treatment of such shifting in reactant structure.

Small households in Kenya are vulnerable to these extreme weather shocks, and failures in effective hedging will make sustainable production extremely difficult for them. The goal of this thesis is to use historical rainfall record in Kenya to forecast rainfall and take quantile of the rainfall distribution to get a trigger for a put-option embedded innovative financial instrument. There are two methods to develop this lower 20% band trigger, which are pert distribution and time series method. Finally, I get two sets of results from two methods. With the help of the simulation results, insurance companies will be able to design a weather-index insurance for small households in Kenya. For farmers, they will use this flexible insurance as an effective substitute for traditional deposit, which requires productive assets as collateral.

Smith, Ph.D. Cornell University 2018 The USGS National GAP Program is a biodiversity mapping program implemented at the state level via the Cooperative Fish & Wildlife Research Units (CFWRU). The New York CFWRU completed NY-GAP analysis in 2001, providing, for the first time, a statewide vertebrate species distribution dataset. A subsequent regional project, HR-GAP, documented 75% of the State‚Äôs terrestrial vertebrates as having a significant portion of their range within the Hudson River Valley region (HR). The presence of high biodiversity in conjunction with development pressures was the impetus for efforts to develop a regional residential growth prediction model, based on Block Group (BG) level Census data, with the purpose of identifying biodiversity regions at risk from future residential development.   Initial efforts resulted in a regression model which predicted 77 of the 2,212 total BG in the study area to be prime candidates for a substantial percentage of the predicted new residential growth. These BGs, classified as intensive growth areas (IGA), were intersected with biodiversity data to quantify that 53% of the State‚Äôs vertebrate species are within and intensive growth BG, as well as 41% of the threatened, endangered, or special concern (TES) species. Additional model development provided a slight improvement to the predictability of the model while using only digitally available regional data. The second model explained 38% of the variance associated with the identification of IGAs and identified the top 5% of BGs showing substantial increases in residential housing units over the last decade. Of the BGs predicted to be areas of fast growth, 53% and 41% were IGAs as computed from 2000 and 2010 Census data, respectively. Of the IGAs predicted for 2000 and 2010, 16% and 8%, respectively, were also species-rich BGs. A third modeling effort was undertaken to improve upon the earlier residential housing prediction models based on regression analysis of Census-based BG data and physiographic variables aggregated to the BG level geography. It was hypothesized that increasing the spatial resolution through dasymetric mapping of the BG data would further improve model results and subsequently the identification of biodiversity areas at risk. The model results from the dasymetric mapping did not reveal significant improvement to earlier model results. Investigations of various alternative Census-based datasets yielded similar results. These efforts to model residential growth at the landscape scale support the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of residential housing growth can be modeled using Census Block Group (BG) level data and other publicly available data to provide a coarse filter for the identification of biodiversity areas at risk from projected residential growth.

Methods: The study was conducted in two phases employing mixed methods.   Phase 1: neighborhood walking group for persons with mild to moderate dementia (N  = 5) using PhotoVoice and photo-elicited surveys.   Phase 2: researchers and practitioners who work with older adults with and without  dementia (N = 9) using photo-elicited survey-cum-interviews.  Results: Public art was slightly more noticeable and attractive than historical buildings.   Characteristics of strong landmarks included having a clear purpose, familiarity,  strategic location within an accessible context, high visibility and contrast, appropriate  relational scale, unique aesthetics, ease of comprehensibility and stability.    Conclusions: Further research is necessary to ascertain relative noticeability   of different landmarks according to type, scale and location. Studies need to also take  into account individual differences that account for diversity in the dementia  experience, to understand the range of perceptions of landmarks.

Specifically, contributions to the following two energy systems are presented, namely an algal biofuel and bioproduct manufacturing system and a shale gas processing and chemical manufacturing system. The algal biofuel and bioproduct manufacturing system is a promising renewable energy system. In the first related project, we propose a comprehensive superstructure of algal biofuel and bioproducts manufacturing processes and a corresponding mixed-integer fractional programming model to determine the optimal process design with the optimal functional unit based economic and environmental performance. Moreover, we develop a tailored global optimization algorithm to efficiently solve the resulting problem. In the second related project, we propose a two-stage adaptive robust mixed-integer fractional programming model to maximize the return on investment under uncertainty in market related parameters. A tailored optimization algorithm is developed to solve the multi-level optimization problem that cannot be handled directly by any off-the-shelf optimization solvers. In the third related project, we develop a consequential life cycle optimization framework that simultaneously optimizes consequential environmental impacts and economic performance. The shale gas processing and chemical manufacturing system is a conventional energy system, but has gained momentum in recent decades due to the successful application of advanced extraction technologies. In the first related project, we develop a general framework for combining product distribution optimization of chemical reactions and superstructure optimization of process flowsheets. A comprehensive superstructure of shale gas processing and chemical manufacturing processes is developed and employed to illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework. In the second related project, we develop a general framework to integrate a novel quantitative measure of resilience and a set of resilience enhancement strategies with process design and operations. The framework identifies a set of disruptive events for a given system, formulates a multiobjective two-stage adaptive robust mixed-integer fractional programming model, and solves the problem with a tailored solution algorithm.

The technical, economic, and environmental performance (TEEP) of GHPs and traditional heating and cooling systems are explored for two applications: 1) cooling-dominated applications in cellular tower shelters nationwide; and 2) community-scale shallow geothermal (GHP) district energy (GSDE) systems for space heating and cooling.     Tens of thousands of cellular towers are in operation across the U.S. often accompanied by small shelters that house electrical equipment continuously generating around 8 kWth of heat.  The annual electricity consumption and corresponding carbon footprint for cooling shelters nationwide with conventional air-source heat pumps (ASHP) is significant.  A systems engineering model (SEM) was developed to assess the TEEP of five cooling configurations for shelters located across various states with different climates and geologies.  The five cooling configurations include: 1) GHP-only; 2) GHP + air-side economizer (AE); 3) GHP + dry-cooler (DC); 4) ASHP-only; and 5) ASHP + AE.   With no consideration of incentives or rebates, base case results show that the total cost of ownership (TCO) for all cooling configurations is the lowest for states located in cooler climates (e.g., Maine, Minnesota, and Colorado), and the highest for states located in warmer climates (e.g., California, Florida).  The configuration with the lowest TCO is ASHP + AE followed by GHP + AE.  The configuration with the highest TCO is GHP-only, followed by GHP + DC and ASHP-only.  Furthermore, the configuration with the lowest lifetime electricity consumption and CO2e emissions is GHP + AE, and the highest is ASHP-only.  With the use of energy-efficient GHP systems, regions with high electricity prices and consumption will experience lower costs and environmental impacts from a reduction in the operating conditions over the lifetime of the system (20 years).   Rust Belt cities in the U.S. have experienced years of severe economic and population decline, but possess many legacies and assets that present opportunities for sustainable revitalization and economic growth.  Several frameworks and tools are proposed to assess the sustainable development potential of Utica, NY.  Specifically, an integrative tool ‚ÄúGeoDistrict‚Äù is developed to assess the technical and economic performance of community-scale GSDE systems for space heating and cooling applications in downtown Utica.   In Utica, GSDE networks are economically feasible for systems designed to cover a portion of the annual peak heating load of the area, with the remainder load covered by a supplemental natural gas peak boiler.  The capital costs and payback period for GSDE systems covering between 50 ‚Äì 70% of the annual peak load of the area (2.7 ‚Äì 6.0 MMBtu/hr) may range from $1.0 million dollars ‚Äì $3.4 million dollars and 12 ‚Äì 19 years, respectively.  For system covering 100% of the annual peak load, the capital costs and payback period may be up to $4.5 million dollars and over 21 years, respectively.  Geothermal systems designed to cover a portion of the area‚Äôs peak load may be economically viable and still provide for heating during a significant portion of the year.

We are interested in classifying smooth toric surfaces with Kazhdan-Lusztig atlases. This involves finding a degeneration of V to a union of Richardson varieties in the flag variety H/B_H of some Kac-Moody group H. We determine which toric surfaces have a chance at having a Kazhdan-Lusztig atlas by looking at their moment polytopes, then describe a way to find a suitable group H. More precisely, we find that (up to equivalence) there are 19 or 20 broken toric surfaces admitting simply-laced atlases, and that there are at most 7543 broken toric surfaces where H is any Kac-Moody group.

Since Vietnam invaded Cambodia at the end of 1978, their bilateral relations became poor. In 1986, Vietnam implemented the ‚ÄúDoi Moi‚Äù policy to solve domestic economic problems. Chatichai Choonhavan the leader of Thailand responded to this new policy of Vietnam with the ‚Äúturning the Indochina battlefields into market places‚Äù policy. These new policies improved the relations between the two countries. In the early 1990s, Thailand and Vietnam focused their cooperation on economic issues. They could agree on many sensitive issues in the late 1990s and cooperated in various areas. In the post-Cold War period, the major powers were unreliable for Vietnam. Unlike the regional organizations established earlier, ASEAN tried to avoid being influenced by major powers. Vietnam became more involved in ASEAN and gained membership in 1995 with Thailand‚Äôs support. Thailand and Vietnam also cooperated in sub-regional organizations.

While there are insightful theorems, due to Laver, about $\sigma$-scattered orders, we will show the class of non-$\sigma$-scattered orders tend to be more chaotic by a number of consistency results. For instance, we show if there is a supercompact cardinal, there is a forcing extension in which there is no minimal non-$\sigma$-scattered linear order. This shows that Laver's theorem regarding $\sigma$-scattered linear orders is sharp. Our work also includes results concerning trees. For instance, we show it is consistent that there is a Kurepa tree which is minimal with respect to club embeddings. Moreover, we show it is consistent that there is a minimal non-$\sigma$-scattered linear order which does not contain any real or Aronszajn type. Working on these problems resulted in a few byproduct theorems as well.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:25:02Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Despite an ever-increasing number of reported COFs, these materials are typically isolated as insoluble nanocrystalline powders with poorly understood growth processes. This dissertation highlights that while there has been tremendous progress in controlling the 2D topology of COFs, there is a much weaker understanding of the factors that guide stacking of the 2D sheets (Chapter 1). We show that by  truncating polyfunctional monomers, we can access hexagonal boronate ester-linked macrocycles that represent direct analogues of 2D COFs that cofacially assemble both in solution and the solid state (Chapter 2). This approach was adapted to imine-linked macrocycles and revealed that crystallization into layered structures stabilizes against rapid hydrolysis (Chapter 3). We then directly studied macrocycle self-assembly as a function of monomer identity and showed, contrary to previous reports, there is little thermodynamic gain when dimethoxy groups were added to the linker monomer (Chapter 4). This work shows that discrete macrocycles are both fascinating structures for studying self-assembly as well as excellent models for understanding the stacking interactions of 2D COFs.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:25:03Z (GMT).

However, the real-time dynamics of chain growth remains unknown. Using magnetic tweezers, we visualized real-time polymer growth at the single-polymer level. Focusing on ring-opening metathesis polymerization, we found that the extension of a growing polymer under a pulling force does not increase continuously but exhibits wait-and-jump steps. These steps are attributable to the formation and unraveling of conformational entanglements from newly incorporated monomers, whose key features can be recapitulated with molecular dynamics simulations. The configurations of these entanglements appear to play a key role in determining the polymerization rates and the dispersion among individual polymers.

This paper identifies how researchers and practitioners situated in different institutions are informed by different systems of knowledge in their study of gender, and what implications this has on what and how they study and on how these actors work together. Key informant interviews with gender specialists from universities, research organizations, NGOs, UN agencies, donors, and the state in Delhi, India are used as an illustration. Gender-related topics are framed in line with organizational frameworks. These specialists have adopted ‚Äòpragmatic‚Äô ways to bridge epistemological divides between the ‚Äògender and development‚Äô and ‚Äòfeminism‚Äô perspectives. The need for ‚Äòevidence‚Äô plays a critical role in changing expectations of researchers and practitioners in the field. By virtue of specialization, knowledge-producing institutions work interdependently towards the common goal of gender justice.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:25:05Z (GMT).

They are also more robust than a single robot, but not free of failures. It is difficult for a human to monitor the swarm, because the state space grows exponentially with the number of robots presenting a very high cognitive load. Moreover, errors in robot swarms propagate non-intuitively and it becomes harder to monitor and debug the swarm. Previous works have looked into enabling control of robot swarms by a human user. We instead present a framework that allows a non- expert user to support the robot swarm in the presence of errors by use of a GUI. It enables monitoring, verification and viewing analysis on both robot and swarm behavior. We believe that this framework is a step forward to moving swarms from lab settings to real-world scenarios.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:25:05Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This thesis will explore the relationship between rural amenities, natural and cultural conservation efforts, development patterns and economic vulnerabilities in three communities in the √áanakkale region of Turkey. Since the 1950s, most rural regions globally have experienced population decreases with the advancement of industrialization and technology. People migrated to the city and left the countryside behind. Recently, these urbanites have begun to visit or temporarily move back to the rural pastoral landscape for vacation, recreation, and retirement. The three case studies chosen for this thesis have a slight decline of agricultural industries and rapid increase in amenity-based economics, like tourism and second-home residents. This raised the question how this shift of industries effects the society and conservation of tangible and intangible resources. Each case study will examine new development patterns, land use, and the results from policies and incentives.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:25:07Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

D. Cornell University 2018 In eutherian mammals, dosage compensation between XX females and XY males occurs in part through X chromosome inactivation (XCI) of one X homolog per cell in females. XCI was previously assumed to be complete across the X-specific regions of X chromosomes, but recently genes outside the pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) have been observed to exhibit low but significant expression from the inactive X in several species. These genes are termed XCI ‚Äúescapers‚Äù. XCI escape introduces gene expression variation between females and males and inflates variation among females. However, it remains unclear whether XCI escape is generally a ‚Äúbug‚Äù in the XCI system ‚Äì that is, merely a consequence of inefficient XCI ‚Äì or a ‚Äúfeature‚Äù required for normal biological function. By comparing XCI profiles across mammals, we can gain insight into the evolutionary history of XC and XCI escape, with the hope that this will improve our understanding of their mechanisms and functions. Here, I describe three analyses motivated by these goals. First, we expanded upon earlier findings to show that human XCI escapers exhibit a greater degree of strong purifying selection, as well as higher and broader gene expression than inactivated genes in both sexes. These results suggest a role for gene expression patterns in determining XCI status after divergence from the Y chromosome. 	Next, we generated a novel XCI profile for the domestic dog from single cell RNA-seq from two female F1 crossbreed dogs. Cell-level gene expression data was used to classify X genes as showing either monoallelic or bialleleic expression in multiple cells. Using this method, we identified 45 putative XCI escapers and 98 putative X-inactivated genes. 	Lastly, we performed a comparative analysis of XCI profiles across human, mouse, dog, and opossum 1:1 X orthologs. This analysis revealed that XCI escape is highly lineage-specific. Despite this, XCI escapers in these species overlap highly in their Gene Ontology biological process annotations. XCI escapers also appear to be under greater evolutionary constraint than inactivated genes within most species, though the magnitude varies. 	Overall, our findings suggest that the forces driving XCI escape evolution vary extensively across genes within and between species."		12/4/18	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:25:08Z (GMT).

Many different techniques for silencing proteins at the DNA or RNA level exist, but new adaptable technologies are needed to effectively silence proteins at the post-translational level, and particularly with post-translational modification resolution. One such technology, developed by the DeLisa laboratory and termed ubiquibodies, hijacks natural cellular mechanisms to silence proteins post-translationally. A synthetic enzyme‚Äîthe ubiquibody‚Äîfunctions by connecting two independent polypeptide domains, a target recognition domain and a catalytic domain via a flexible linker. This project has focused on mapping the tolerances of the ubiquibody technology. Expanding the range of silenced targets has been a key goal, as well as investigation into each of the three ubiquibody domains: target recognition, catalytic, and the linker between.		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:25:09Z (GMT).

This body of work serves as preliminary research for the Ecological Calendars for Climate Adaptation in the Pamirs project, led by Dr. Karim-Aly Kassam at Cornell University and funded by the National Science Foundation and the Belmont Forum. Fundamentally, this research addresses issues of food security in subsistence communities in the context of climate change, while acknowledging the critical role of ecological knowledge holders in building adaptive capacity for future change. Past scholarship on traditional ecological knowledge, feminist political ecology, decolonial methodologies, indigenous feminisms, and critical ethnography have informed the research methodologies and analysis. I use Kassam‚Äôs (2009) Human Ecological Lens as a tool in analyzing areas of complexity and nuance in this research: diversity of knowledges, microclimate and biological diversity, contexts of Soviet history, and embodied knowledge. I look towards a Decolonial Feminist Political Ecology framework (Rocheleau and Nirmal 2015) in situating future research.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:25:10Z (GMT).

Plants are placed into cold storage at a marketable stage and kept there until it is time for sale. There are still questions about how this storage impacts flower quality. The focus of this research was to determine how temperature and duration of postharvest cold storage affect carbohydrate status and flower life of potted tulips, and how tulips respond once out of storage. Changes associated with senescence such as lipid peroxidation and carbohydrate status were studied in order to characterize tepal senescence. There were changes in plants held at warmer temperatures for longer durations that demonstrate continued development in postharvest storage. It was concluded that best flower quality resulted from storage for < 1 week at all temperatures. For durations > 3 weeks, best flower quality resulted from storage at 1¬∫C.

Most studies have only examined the spatial distribution of the electronic phenomena ‚Äì including potential, photopotential, capacitance, photocapacitance, current, and photocurrent ‚Äì however, there is much to be learned by measuring and mapping the time-dependence of these characteristics. In organic bulk heterojunction solar cells, Ginger and coworkers have shown by time-resolved electrostatic force microscopy (tr-EFM) that the microscopic photocapacitance charging rate in a film is directly proportional to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of a photovoltaic device. Transients with sub-microsecond time resolution have been collected, but acquiring these transients required long signal-averaging times. Building on the previous work of Moore, Marohn, and co-workers, we developed a method to rapidly acquire transients of capacitance, frequency and phase indirectly, in a stepped-time, stepped-voltage experiment, by encoding and measuring the capacitance as a change in the phase of a vibrating cantilever. In a proof-of-concept experiment we show that this new method is viable for observing transients down to 100 Œºsec. This approach represents an exciting new route to understanding geminate recombination in photovoltaic materials. Mitochondrial calcium plays a critical role in regulating cell survival, apoptotic pathways, and cellular energetics. Acute overload of mitochondrial calcium will induce cell death and is implicated in the damage caused by lethal reperfusion injury. Inhibitors of mitochondrial calcium uptake minimize the harm caused by such conditions. The most well characterized mitochondrial calcium uptake inhibitor is Ru360, a Œº-oxo-bridged dinuclear ruthenium complex. Its synthesis and purification is challenged by extremely low yielding reactions and purification by tedious cation exchange chromatography. Furthermore, this compound is not cell permeable, a feature that significantly limits its biological use. With the goal of preparing potent mitochondrial calcium uptake inhibitors that are biologically available, we investigated the synthesis and characterization of six dinuclear ruthenium species. One complex is a structural analog of Ru360, and five are structurally similar dinuclear ruthenium Œº-nitrido complexes. These compounds were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, EPR spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, conductivity, and small-molecule crystallography. Mitochondrial calcium uptake inhibitory activity in permeabilized and unpermeabilized cells are described. Cellular uptake of the complexes and cytotoxicity are presented and discussed in the context of molecular structure. One of these complexes shows 10√ó better MCU-inhibitory activity, low cytotoxicity, and enhanced cellular uptake compared to Ru360.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:25:11Z (GMT).

A new AR-enabled navigation aid prototype was developed for this study. Its user ratings and navigation performance records were compared to those of a printed map. A total of 50 college students participated in the study, and each participant experienced two conditions with different navigation routes presented in a randomized order. During each condition, participant performed a navigation task with a destination and a route recall task to retrace the navigation path without any navigation aid. The results showed that in terms of navigation task, participants required shorter navigation time and made fewer errors with an AR-enabled navigation aid than with a printed map. The results of route recall task demonstrated a significant effect of participants‚Äô culture. In the printed map condition, East Asians required shorter route recall time and made fewer errors than European Americans. In the AR-enabled navigation aid condition, European Americans required shorter route recall time and made fewer errors than East Asians. Findings from the current study highlight new factors such as individual differences shaped by culture in affecting a person‚Äôs navigation behavior. Such findings will be beneficial to researchers and app developers interested in successfully merging AR technologies with current indoor navigation aids.

A recent research studies how that unidirectional mode couples into the free space, aiming to incorporate this PTI into integrated photonic structures. Here we focus on light-refraction from a two-dimensional valley PTI into the free space. We understand this PTI as a waveguide, model its refraction as the radiation of an array of dipoles, and demonstrate several ways to engineer its dispersion relation. We also confirm the nontrivial topology of this PTI by unveiling its non-zero Berry curvature at the valley. This study may benefit future research on photonic topological behaviors and realizing novel photonic phenomenon.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:25:12Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The local question involves Kazhdan-Lusztig varieties which can be degenerated to affine toric schemes defined using the Stanley-Reisner ideal of a subword complex. The blow-up along the boundary in this toric case is in fact Gorenstein. We show that there exists a degeneration of the blow-up of the Kazhdan-Lusztig variety to this Gorenstein scheme, allowing us to extend this result to Schubert varieties in general. The potential use of this one-step Gorensteinization to describe the non-Gorenstein locus of Schubert varieties is discussed, as well as the relationship between Gorensteinizations and the convergence of the Nash blow-up process in the toric case.

Bridging aesthetics, media, and reception studies, this dissertation presents a more diverse picture. Analyzing the works of three key figures ‚Äì Friedrich Klopstock, G.E. Lessing, and Kant himself ‚Äì it suggests that aesthetics instead respond to a secular crisis of authority precipitated by the emergence of a bourgeois reading public coming into self-consciousness of its own autonomy. As theories about the essential relation between a subject and a shared sensible world, aesthetics are theories about a subject‚Äôs essential relation to community, in the absence of the external authority operative in religion, feudalism, and Leibnizean/ Wolffean rationalism. This study claims that aesthetics are influenced by two models for a subjective relationship to community present in eighteenth-century Germany: Protestantism and Pietism. While Max Weber has suggested that, in substituting external authority for a subjective principle, Protestantism offers a model for secular community based on individual distinction, this study claims that German Pietism offers an alternative at odds with individualism: oriented instead towards an experience of spiritual community in the present. These two models inform two genealogies of aesthetics catalyzed by the emergence of print. Humanist aesthetics, such as those of Kant and late Lessing, reinforce the isolation of the print medium by emphasizing autonomous experience and privileging written media. By contrast, in the work of Friedrich Klopstock emerges a nationalist strain that, influenced by Pietism, is in tension with reading, emphasizing live performance and forms of print distribution binding individuals into more substantive contact. Analyzing Klopstock and Lessing‚Äôs poetry, plays, and political allegories, this study shows how these aesthetic practices actively seek to organize different forms of secular community around sensible presentations. This dissertation ultimately seeks both to uncover a history of nationalist aesthetics obscured by humanist histories of aesthetics, and develop a methodology for understanding the role of aesthetic and medial practices in producing normative forms of secular community in the absence of absolute authority.

Living in a profoundly agrarian world, the Athenians c. 510-413 BCE, Syracusans c. 483-380, and Romans c. 396-264 each created imperial territories by dividing up, or ‚Äúallotting,‚Äù land they confiscated in war. They also experimented with forms of republicanism: as citizens, they participated in popular assemblies, fought together, and shared access to imperial land. By exploring the historical links between land allotment and shared governance, I reconstruct how the citizen communities at Athens, Syracuse, and Rome developed alongside new ideas about imperial territory, mobility, and the value of labor.  Because land allotment moved people to and from confiscated land, and in and out of each republic, it also reorganized, concentrated, and displaced people within each empire. However, the way the Athenians, Syracusans, and Romans allotted land had drastically different effects on how people moved across the three empires: the Athenians went to great lengths to keep their citizen lotholders at home in Attica, whereas the Syracusans brought the people they dispossessed back to Syracuse to become citizens, and the Romans sent their citizens away from Rome, all across central Italy. I develop a new heuristic model for historians to explain why each group allotted land as they did by drawing on recent trends in Francophone political geography and the macroeconomic concept of human capital. By reframing historical texts with archaeological case studies, I show how each group collectively drew lessons from their own political culture to imagine their imperial territory, and then how they used land allotment to find their citizens‚Äô place within it. As such, land allotment was a means to an end, more self-reflexive than aimed at imperial control: instead, I argue that the three patterns of land allotment can be distinguished, first and foremost, in the way each community valued and accumulated human capital. Comparing the three approaches to land allotment allows us to confront and turn on its head the consensus among historians that people in antiquity allotted land primarily as a state-strategy of imperial control. Altogether, it recaptures some of the many ways people in antiquity reconciled empire with citizenship and, in doing so, how land allotment helped shape the political and economic history of the ancient Mediterranean world.		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:25:15Z (GMT).

As a result, vision systems have started to be broadly adopted in everyday applications. Progress has been particularly promising in image recognition, where algorithms now often match human performance. Nevertheless, vision systems still largely fall behind humans in their ability to understand the complexities of the visual world and its apparent contradictions. For example, an image can carry different meanings to different people in different contexts. However, being often limited to a single point of view, vision systems tend to focus on the meaning that dominates in the training data. In this dissertation, we address this limitation by building conditional vision models that can learn from multiple points of view and adapt their results to account for different conditions. First, we address the related tasks of image tagging and tag based image retrieval. In particular, we build a system that can take into account the fact that people may associate different meaning with certain images and tags. Thus, the system can personalize outputs for ambiguous tags such as #rock, which could refer either to a music genre, a geological object or even outdoor climbing. Further, we focus on the task of image based similarity search. Specifically, we design a system that can understand multiple notions of similarity. For example, when searching for related items to an input images of a shoe, users might be interested in shoes of similar color, style, or for the same kind of activity. By capturing the multitude of aspects in terms of which objects can be compared, our system can find the right set of related items. Lastly, we explore how the underlying convolutional networks themselves can be made aware of the context in which they are used. In a study, we first discover a new understanding of the roles that individual layers take on in modern convolutional networks. Then, we leverage our insights and design a network that can adaptively define its own topology conditioned on the input image to increase both accuracy and efficiency.

Folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism (FOCM) is a metabolic network compartmentalized in mitochondria, nucleus, and cytosol, where one-carbon units participate in the de novo synthesis of purines, thymidylate, and methionine metabolism. Either increase or decrease in mitochondrial dTTP pools reduces mtDNA content. However, FOCM has never been investigated as a pathway leading to loss of mtDNA integrity in MDS patients. Folate deficiency reduces de novo dTMP synthesis and increases uracil levels in nuclear DNA (nuDNA). Uracil misincorporation is not mutagenic but affects DNA integrity by inducing chromosome fragmentation and eventually apoptosis. Our knowledge of factors that contribute to uracil accumulation in mtDNA is limited but is expected to mirror uracil misincorporation in nuDNA. Enzymatic disruption of nuclear de novo dTMP synthesis due to lack of SHMT in mice and lack of mitochondrial SHMT2 in CHO cells results in reduced dTMP synthesis capacity. Similarly, mice deficient in MPV17, a protein of unknown function associated with hepatocerebral MDS, have reduced mitochondrial dTMP pools. This study investigates the role of genetic (MPV17 and SHMT2) and non-genetic factors (folate, glycine, and serine) on mtDNA integrity, in the context of mitochondrial de novo dTMP synthesis.  These results reveal that mtDNA integrity is compromised in HeLa cells deficient in either MPV17 or SHMT2. MPV17-deficient cells exhibited reduced mitochondrial folate levels, suggesting it interacts with mitochondrial FOCM. Both, cells cultured in folate-depleted medium and MPV17-deficient cells, exhibit elevated uracil accumulation in mtDNA by at least 3-fold. Mitochondrial dTMP synthesis capacity and its incorporation into mtDNA were not affected in MPV17-deficient cells, but the elevated uracil levels imply that availability of dTMP for mtDNA synthesis is compromised. I propose that MPV17 is a mitochondrial dTMP transporter. SHMT2-deficient cells exhibited 164% more mtDNA content than control cells; glycine and serine in the culture medium did not have an effect, indicating that SHMT2 catalytic activity is fundamental for mitochondrial function. These data suggest that FOCM is involved in maintaining mtDNA integrity, which is highly susceptible to uracil misincorporation.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:25:17Z (GMT).

Homologous chromosome pairing and meiotic recombination are two defining processes of prophase I of meiosis and are required for the generation of genetic variation. Core proteins involved in these processes are well studied, but it is not well understood how meiosis is regulated. In this dissertation, I shed light on how meiosis is regulated by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in Arabidopsis thaliana, as well as how meiotic recombination is regulated by chromatin in maize. Many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified in various species but few have been functionally analyzed. Of the few lncRNAs that have been analyzed, they have been found to play roles in regulating gene expression and modifying chromatin. However, the functions of the vast majority of them are unknown and no lncRNAs have been identified in Arabidopsis meiosis. On the other hand, significantly more genes are expressed during meiosis than the number of genes actually required for meiosis completion, suggesting that there is a mechanism controlling gene expression post-transcriptionally, possibly involving lncRNAs. This situation prompted us to conduct a systematic analysis of lncRNAs in Arabidopsis meiosis. We generated a bioinformatics pipeline that utilizes RNA-seq data from Arabidopsis meiocytes and somatic tissues to identify novel lncRNAs that are specific to meiosis. We then established a multistep mutant screen to identify lncRNAs that are functional in meiosis and found that lncRNAs play a role in overall fertility in Arabidopsis thaliana.  Chapter 3 of this dissertation focuses on understanding the role of chromatin in the regulation of meiotic recombination events that result in crossovers (COs) in maize. In this species, double strand breaks (DSBs) are evenly distributed along chromosomes, including pericentromeric and centromeric regions. However, CO distribution does not follow the DSB distribution. Instead, COs are enriched in distal chromosome regions and suppressed in pericentromeric and centromeric regions. We investigated the dynamics of recombination events in relationship to chromatin states in order to understand how this distribution is formed. We further studied the CO/non-crossover (NCO) decision through its relationship with chromatin. We found that DNA methylation is a major contributor to the decision of which DSBs become COs and this decision is progressively enforced when meiotic DSBs are repaired. Interestingly, this process proceeds differently in B73 and CML228, two maize inbreds with dramatically differing numbers of recombination events.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:25:19Z (GMT).

Bacterial spoilage is the largest contributing factor for product loss of pasteurized fluid milk.  Microbes can be present in pasteurized milk via two main routes: (i) survival of pasteurization by bacteria present in raw milk (generally Gram-positive sporeformers), and (ii) post-pasteurization contamination (PPC) of the product.  This product spoilage is further complicated when spoilage microbes can survive refrigeration temperatures and even grow in the cold storage climate.  The studies presented here focused on ways to achieve higher quality, longer lasting pasteurized fluid milk by exploring (i) the application of molecular technologies to better understand and potentially track psychrotolerant coliforms responsible for post-pasteurization contamination of fluid milk and (ii) the associations between psychrotolerant sporeforming spoilage organism presence in fluid milk and dairy farm management practices.  Our data revealed that psychrotolerant coliforms introduced as PPC in fluid milk have considerable taxonomic and phenotypic diversity, indicating that hygienic issues within a fluid milk processing plant may lead to introduction of a diverse group of coliform contaminants capable of having a direct impact on pasteurized milk quality and the consumer‚Äôs sensory experience.  Our cross-sectional study identified dairy farm management practices related to milking time hygiene may simultaneously lower bulk tank somatic cell count on dairy farms as well as psychrotolerant sporeformer levels in bulk tank milk, suggesting that on-farm adjustments in management specifically focused on udder cleanliness may directly impact the shelf-life of pasteurized fluid milk.  Finally, we showed through our longitudinal study that dairy farm management practices related to overall farm cleanliness were associated with a decrease in the presence of psychrotolerant Bacillales spores in bulk tank milk after 21 days at 6¬∞C post-heat treatment.  The combined results from the cross-sectional and longitudinal studies indicate that on-farm adjustments in management focused on both general farm and cow cleanliness may have a direct impact on psychrotolerant Bacillales spore presence and therefore impact the shelf-life of pasteurized fluid milk.  The studies presented here contribute to our understanding of psychrotolerant spoilage organisms isolated from fluid milk and provide insights into potential control strategies aimed at achieving high quality, longer lasting pasteurized fluid milk.

It is estimated that in the US alone there are as many as three million people with T1D, with approximately 80 newly diagnosed patients every day. One in every 400 children and adolescents in the US has T1D and the rate of T1D incidence among children under the age of 14 is estimated to increase by 3% annually worldwide. Current treatments include injections and infusion of exogenous insulin and require constant attention and strict patient compliance. The transplantation of pancreases or islets offers a better alternative. However, its wide application is limited by the need for long-term immunosuppression and a persistent shortage of donor organs. Cell encapsulation has been shown to hold promise for effective, long-term treatment of T1D. However, encapsulation systems developed to date still face various challenges. For example, alginate hydrogel capsules, despite their biocompatibility and function, are difficult to retrieve or replace completely due to the large number of capsules required for effective treatment and the complicated organ structures in the transplantation site (i.e. peritoneal space), contributing to risks and concerns in case of transplant failure or medical complications. On the other hand, macroscopic devices (e.g. planar diffusion chambers), although considered retrievable, are challenging to scale up to a clinically relevant capacity due to their small surface area for mass transfer. In this thesis, I present three independent yet correlated research projects developing advanced cell encapsulation systems. Firstly, I developed a novel method to fabricate toroidal particles. Alginate hydrogel toroidal particles have a shorter diffusion path within compared to conventional spherical alginate hydrogel particles, facilitating mass transport and benefiting encapsulated cells. Secondly, to enhance the mechanical robustness of the hydrogel and prevent cells from escaping, I engineered a novel nanofiber-enabled encapsulation device by combining electrospun nanofibers with biocompatible hydrogel. Last but not least, to further push cell encapsulation therapies toward clinical applications, I designed a retrievable and scalable device. I demonstrated the therapeutic potential of the device through the correction of chemically induced diabetes in C57BL/6 mice using rat islets for 3 months as well as in immunodeficient SCID-Beige mice using human islets for 4 months. I further showed, as a proof of concept, the scalability and retrievability of the device in dogs. In general, these projects may contribute to a cellular therapy for T1D.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:25:21Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The present study investigated whether sharing different types of memories, personal or vicarious, specific or generic, would have any difference in the effects on developing relationship closeness. In addition, the cultural effect, whether the subjects were Euro-Americans or Asians, are tested in the study. Participants (n=481) were presented with 10 scenarios of five types of conservation contents (conversations involving general personal memory, specific personal memory, general vicarious memory, specific vicarious memory, and non-person information) followed by several questions testing the degree of closeness to the hypothetical character in each scenario. This study provides evidence that the protagonist of memory influences the effect of developing closeness, and there is also an interaction between the specificity of memory and the identity of the protagonist in memory. Moreover, Asian participants are more likely than Euro-American participants to feel closer to people who shared the same memories. These findings substantiate the conceptual model of social function of autobiographical memory and contribute to understanding cultural impacts on the association between memory sharing and relationship closeness.

Associations among the phenotypes and genotypes of a training population are used to predict the performance of un-phenotyped target populations. Traditionally, the markers used in these studies are treated similarly, irrespective of their position in the genome, their proximity to regulatory elements, or whether they reside within biologically-relevant genes. The content of this dissertation aims to both identify ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù regions in the cassava (Manihot esculenta) genome and test whether the incorporation of prior biological knowledge enhances the accuracy of GP models in this crop. In 2013, at the onset of this research, very few genomic resources were available within the cassava research community; a draft of the genome sequence had recently been released and a solid platform for low-coverage genotyping using genotyping-bysequencing (GBS) was online. As a means of generating more genomic resources, we first began by identifying nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) genes associated with biotic resistance across the cassava genome. We then leveraged the  NBS-LRR information, together with genomic annotations and a transcriptomics experiment, in a second study to identify genes involved in the interaction of cassava with Cassava Brown Streak Virus (CBSV). We later used biologically-informed GP methods to compare models with and without biologically-relevant information. Until the final phase of our research, our efforts had focused on identifying functional elements within the coding fraction of the genome. In an effort to build upon several genome-wide association (GWA) studies illustrating the importance of regulatory regions outside genes, the third study explored cassava‚Äôs nascent transcriptome. In doing so, we were able to identify key components of plant transcriptional regulation and candidate enhancer regions that not been previously described. Moreover, we showed that these candidate enhancer regions contributed disproportionately to the SNP heritability of several complex traits. The research presented herein provides holistic insight into cassava‚Äôs genomic resources, and it is our hope that it is useful to future research and breeding endeavors within this staple crop species.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:25:22Z (GMT).

Various novel transistor structures which utilize MITs have been suggested and realized to produce more energy efficient transistors. To achieve practical operation temperatures for device applications, however, MIT materials with transition temperatures below 400 K are unsuitable. This work focuses on one MIT material with a high temperature transition, LaCoO<sub>3</sub>. Using oxide molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) a series of LaCoO<sub>3-<i>x</i></sub> thin films with varied La and Co compositions were grown. All films were grown on LaAlO<sub>3</sub> (001)<sub><i>p</i></sub> substrates, which like LaCoO<sub>3</sub>, has a pseudocubic perovskite structure. The lattice mismatch is less than 0.9%. X-ray diffraction <i>Œ∏</i>-2<i>Œ∏</i> measurements were used to assess the structure of the films; the out-of-plane lattice constant of each film was calculated using a Nelson-Riley analysis. The temperature-dependent resistivity of each film was measured and each shows a change in electrical resistivity of more than two orders of magnitude in the MIT temperature range of 400 - 600 K, which is similar to that of bulk single crystal LaCoO<sub>3</sub>. The abruptness and magnitude of the MIT is found to be insensitive to the film composition for samples ranging from La<sub>1.1</sub>CoO<sub>3-<i>x</i></sub> to LaCo<sub>1.1</sub>O<sub>3-<i>x</i></sub>.		6/8/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:25:24Z (GMT).

The extent to which this deleterious variation burdens human genomes and the mechanisms by which these mutations exert their function, though, remains largely unexplored. To help address this gap, I have contributed towards the development of interactome-scale tools for interrogating missense variation in human disease as well as experimentally measured the impact of thousands of human missense variants on protein interactions and stability. The accumulation of these efforts have helped in characterizing molecular mechanisms of disease-associated mutations and have enabled new insights towards the extent to which functional variation segregates across different human populations.  	To begin, the development of a massively parallel, site-directed mutagenesis platform for cloning DNA variants, named Clone-seq, is discussed. A study of the impact of 204 disease-associated mutations on protein interactions and stability is then detailed to demonstrate the utility of Clone-seq in genomic studies. Next, an extensive study of >2,000 missense mutations is presented in which widespread protein interaction perturbations by both rare and common human population variants is unveiled. Disruptive variants were found to be enriched within conserved sites in the genome and occurred at increasingly higher rates as allele frequency decreased. Evidence suggesting that disruptive variants persist primarily in less essential regions of the genome is then presented followed by a demonstration of how shared interaction perturbation profiles between population variants and disease-associated mutations can be applied to identify candidate disease-associated mutations from sequencing data. Lastly, the development of an integrated computational and experimental platform for prioritizing de novo missense mutations in developmental disorders is discussed. 	While protein interaction perturbations represent only one of a multitude of ways in which DNA variants can alter cellular function, nonetheless, the genetic, protein interaction, and population-level insights presented here should represent an important step forward towards an improved understanding of the evolutionary forces that shape the human genome and protein function."		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:25:24Z (GMT).

Through design of the waveguide dispersion the phase-matching conditions for specific nonlinear interactions can be satisfied. Nonlinear interactions such as four-wave mixing, soliton fission, and Raman scattering allow for the generation of broadband spectra from a narrowband pump.     This dissertation presents research into the generation of broadband spectra in dispersion engineered silicon nitride waveguides and microresonators. Utilizing continuous wave pumping we demonstrate parametric frequency comb generation in microresonators at repetition rates suitable for fast electronics. We explore the possibility of generating a modelocked comb spectrum in a microresonator pumped by an external cavity with an embedded optical amplifier. Coherent supercontinuum generation at 1-GHz repetiton rates is realized in silicon nitride waveguides utilizing a modelocked laser at 1 Œºm. We expand the limits of coherent octavespanning supercontinuum generation in silicon nitride waveguides to include low pump pulse energies and picosecond pulse durations for f-2f interferometry.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:25:25Z (GMT).

Farred, Grant Aubrey||Hodzic, Saida	2018-10-22T17:25:27Z			5/30/18		‚ÄúCreature of Theory: Maternity amongst the Ghosts and Strangers‚Äù uses a personal account of the maternal relation to disrupt conventional narratives of birth. Typically, birth is understood to be a discrete, singular event of origin and genesis that closely binds woman and child. This understanding constrains definitions of maternity and regulates political and philosophical assumptions of belonging. ‚ÄúCreature of Theory‚Äù challenges this view, joining personal anecdote and critical theory in a phenomenology of maternity that foregrounds the repetitions and hauntings of birth, undoing the temporalities and identities this act is presumed to produce. Drawing on Maurice Merleau-Ponty‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Intertwining‚ÄîThe Chiasm‚Äù and other highly influential philosophical arguments on touch, this dissertation suggests that moments of skin-to-skin repeat and replace birth as a site of origin, while troubling the body‚Äôs material bounds. Along with Merleau-Ponty, it uses Jacques Derrida‚Äôs theory of hospitality to emphasize the strangeness of the infant, transforming maternity into an encounter characterized by haunting and strange dwelling. In addition, this dissertation brings together Elissa Marder‚Äôs concept of photographic writing and Michel Foucault‚Äôs notion of care of the self to describe how the act of writing recreates the effects of birth, complicating its singularity and naturalness. By challenging common understandings of birth, ‚ÄúCreature of Theory‚Äù alleviates concerns of essentialism in relation to the subject of maternity and resists its political appropriation. Moreover, the chiasmic modes of subjectivity that ‚ÄúCreature of Theory‚Äù describes alter and expand the time and space of ethical encounter. This phenomenology not only challenges dominant ideologies and representations of motherhood, but it also re-frames highly influential theory, showing its place in this intensely close and tactual relation.		6/4/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:25:27Z (GMT).

How individual organisms and their collective behaviors impact the global structure and in turn how the dynamics of the whole, shape the individual units remain outstanding research topics in both physiological and pathological contexts ‚Äì Studies of these topics provide insight into the fundamentals of tissue development and open new routes to therapeutic strategies for various diseases. This thesis is an exploration of several research topics underlying the structural and functional outcomes of multi-scale interactions in tissues using both experimental and computational approaches. This thesis has five chapters. In the first chapter, motivations for each of the studies are discussed. The fundamental concepts involved in these studies are also introduced. The second chapter discusses the first study of the thesis. This study focuses on the understanding of anastomosis during angiogenesis and vasculogenesis and the dynamics of endothelial cells in these processes with an experimental set-up in vitro. The third chapter discusses a study aiming to dissect the impact of three common hypotheses in cancer metabolism on solid tumor growth by building a multi-scale modeling platform using various computational tools. The fourth chapter discusses an experimental study on how breast cancer cells mitigate redox homeostasis in the mitochondria under chronic hypoxia.

These new methods can be applied to the study of any structures at depth as long as there is an adequate distribution of local seismic energy available for effective illumination. Introduction places the research reported in this dissertation in the context of the broader field of seismic imaging. Chapter 1 investigates geometries favorable to body wave imaging by interferometric analysis of distributed but known subsurface sources, with application to the aftershock sequence of the 2011 Mw 5.8 Virginia earthquake. Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 use microseismicity recordings at the geothermal field at Krafla, Iceland, to image magmatic features at depth using two distinct approaches: seismic interferometry and reverse Vertical Seismic Profiling (rVSP). Strong reflections from a body at the same depth as magma encountered in boreholes at Krafla, Iceland were detected and mapped by both techniques. Deeper reflectors suggest a distributed system of smaller magma sills rather than a large pervasively molten feeder chamber at Krafla. Chapter 4 reports an effort to use subduction zone earthquakes in central Alaska to produce a high resolution image of the subducting oceanic lithosphere. The results include one of the first seismic images using an interferometric method with local earthquakes to successfully image mantle structure with a greater resolution than that previously achieved with more conventional methods. Chapter 5 of this dissertation presents the first industry scale 3D reflection image of deep intrabasement features in the United States, generated by opportunistic processing of pre-existing oil exploration data. More importantly, this work illustrates how modern, nodal industry seismic reflection surveys are routinely collecting 3D imagery that- if preserved and properly processed- can yield important new insights into the structure and evolution of the deeper parts of the earth.		6/4/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T17:25:28Z (GMT).

In this regard, metal based batteries comprising of a reactive metal (like Li, Na, Al) as anode have attracted significant attention because of their promise of improving the anode-specific capacity by as much 10-fold, compared to the current state-of-art Li-ion battery using graphitic anode. Perhaps their greatest advantage lies in the possibility of using of a Li-free high-capacity cathode like oxygen that can improve the gravimetric energy density of batteries from ~0.3kWh/kg to ~12kWh/kg (i.e. comparable to the useful energy available from combustion of hydrocarbons). A persistent challenge with batteries based on metallic anodes, concerns their propensity to fail by short-circuits produced by dendrite growth during battery recharge, as well as by runaway of the cell resistance due to internal side reactions with liquid electrolytes. The work reported in this thesis utilizes multiscale transport modeling and experiments to fundamentally understand and to thereby develop rational designs for polymer electrolytes and electrode ‚Äì electrolyte interphases that overcome these challenges . On the basis of a linear stability analysis of dendrite growth during metal electrodeposition, it is shown that the length ‚Äì scale on which transport occurs near the electrodes can be as important as electrolyte modulus in stabilizing metals against dendrite formation. To evaluate this proposal, cross-linked polymer electrolytes were designed with tunable pore size and the stability of metal electrodeposition was quantified in these systems. Direct visualization of electrodeposition using these electrolytes showed remarkable agreement with the theoretical predictions. Furthermore, when operated in a battery, the crosslinked membrane demonstrated stable galvanostatic cycling of lithium metal anodes for several hundreds of hours. Importantly, these studies showed that while the tendency for battery failure by dendrite-induced short-circuits can be reduced, the issue of capacity-fading as a result of continuous reactions of the metal with liquid electrolyte persists. Through multiscale modeling of ion transport, artificial solid electrolyte interphase designs are proposed for lithium-oxygen batteries to enable stable recharge and low overpotentials even with chemically reactive liquid electrolytes.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:44:42Z (GMT).

The majority of existing online language learning systems use the traditional grammar-translation approach (i.e. a focus on grammar and translation skills) to language learning. This approach has inherent scale limitations because learning materials must be carefully designed by experts, often requires that learners engage with topics that are irrelevant to their goals and interests, and lacks contextual information that is important for language skill. However, drawing from communicative language approaches (i.e. approaches that focus on meaning rather than correctness, and assess learners based on the activities that they can engage in rather than their knowledge of rules and vocabulary), we can reimagine the design of online language learning to overcome these challenges. Through discussion of three projects, I show that by leveraging readily available native-speaker media, automation, and communicative-learning approaches, we can use (i) learner activity from even novice learners to annotate learning materials (e.g. captions and phonetic readings), (ii) freely available videos and speech recognition to enable contextualized learning practice, and (iii) videos and captions to generate automated learning assessments that capture general proficiency rather than specific vocabulary and grammar knowledge.  This work makes contributions in areas of design, language education, language research methodology, and language learning theory. In design, this work shows how we can build effective language learning experiences around existing materials. In language education, this work generated new learning systems which have been used by independent learners and in classrooms. In language research methodology, this work contributes a new way for researchers to assess learner proficiency using a quick test generated from existing materials. Finally, in language learning theory, this work shows a paradigm shift from the grammar-translation approach to a communicative approach in language system design.

Cohen, Claude||Wiesner, Ulrich B.	2018-10-22T18:44:44Z			8/30/18		Global electricity production from renewable sources has grown dramatically in recent years. While this has fostered lower dependence on carbon-based energy generation, the intermittent nature of these renewable energy resources has introduced new technical challenges to regional electrical grids. One approach to address intermittent energy generation and associated inefficiencies is to introduce grid-scale electricity storage using redox flow batteries. Redox flow batteries provide a reasonably stable, long-term means to store renewable energy. Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRBs) have been of particular interest due to their chemical stability, long life cyclability, and potential for high capacity electrical storage. VRBs also have a number of research challenges. One key factor limiting market penetration of redox flow batteries in energy storage portfolios is the high capital cost associated with a comparatively low power density technology. To this end, current research efforts focus on improving the energy density of VRBs to warrant this cost in the long term. This work focuses on four approaches to improve the power density of VRBs: the use of conductive membrane coatings, the generation of electroactive hydrophilic surface functional groups, use of drop-in electrocatalysts via direct reduction of metal salts, and chemical synthesis of lead oxide particles on the VRB anode. First, it is demonstrated that the rate capability of VRBs can be improved by electrospray deposition of a conductive carbon/binder mixture onto the surface of the ion-exchange membrane in a VRB. This work goes on to show dramatic rate improvements by hydrothermally treating graphite felt electrodes with various surface modifiers, most notably ammonium persulfate. Alternative approaches to improve the current density of a VRB involve the use of electrocatalysts on the surface of the anode. This work shows that the use of drop-in metal salts and the chemical synthesis of lead oxides are both facile routes to form catalytically-active nanoparticles on the surface of the VRB anode, which significantly accelerate the kinetics of otherwise sluggish anodic reactions in VRBs. These four methods each offer a commercially scalable and inexpensive pathway to increasing the capacity and power density of aqueous vanadium redox flow batteries.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:44:44Z (GMT).

Erickson, David	2018-10-22T18:44:45Z			8/30/18		Soft robots, composed of intrinsically soft materials, have continuously deformable structures that help them generate muscle-like actuators. Most conventional soft robots utilize compressed air/liquid to actuate, which involves bulky power sources that may sacrifice their flexibility. This work introduces a new class of light-induced actuation to the field of soft robotics by using light to reversibly trigger a bending/unbending motion. This new actuation mechanism is enabled by the trans-cis isomerization of azobenzene molecules. Based on this mechanism, photomechanical switches were made by covalently incorporating these molecules into a polyurethane-polyurea copolymer via a two-stage step-growth polymerization. The synthesized elastomeric photomechanical switches demonstrate good optical and mechanical properties: under the actuation wavelength (UV 385nm), they can generate maximum bending angle of 70 degrees with the photomechanical stress of 17 kPa. In addition, the supramolecular network in the switches realizes autonomous self-healing at room temperature with high efficiency (recovers 70% of maximum strain at break of the pristine sample). We envision this new material with simple molecular design will provide new directions for research in bio-inspired materials and future soft robotics.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:44:45Z (GMT).

Despite the inference problem being NP-hard, a large number of approximation algorithms, e.g., graphcuts, have been studied, although all of these methods are computationally expensive. We observed that most problems in practice contains a large easy part and a small hard part. Therefore, in this thesis, we investigated a few persistency-based approaches which could compute optimal labeling for a large set of variables efficiently and reduce the scale of the problem that the expensive inference algorithms need to solve. In particular, we will explore two different lines of research. The first direction focuses on generalizing the sufficient local condition to check persistency on a set of variables as opposed to a single variable in previous works, and provides a hierarchical relaxation to trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. The second direction gives a discriminative view of persistency, which allow us to label more variables optimally with a small cost to label a few wrongly. This thesis will present a literature study of persistency used for MRF inference, the mathematical formalization of the algorithms and the experimental results for both the first-order and higher-order MRF inference problems.

Among hyperbolic groups, Wise characterized hyperbolic virtually compact special groups as the hyperbolic groups that virtually admit a quasiconvex hierarchy terminating in finite groups. The main result of this thesis is that every relatively hyperbolic fundamental group of a virtually compact special non-positively curved cube complex virtually admits a quasiconvex hierarchy terminating in peripheral subgroups, answering a question due to Wise.  The proof of the main theorem roughly follows the outline of Agol, Groves and Manning's New Proof of Wise's Malnormal Special Quotient Theorem for hyperbolic groups, but instead uses relatively hyperbolic geometric tools to prove that Wise's double dot hierarchy construction yields a quasiconvex hierarchy. Group theoretic relatively hyperbolic Dehn filling and the main theorem are used in the final chapter to provide a new proof of a relatively hyperbolic analog of Wise's malnormal special quotient theorem.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:44:46Z (GMT).

In either case, the methods under consideration use a tree or a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that encodes relations among parameters as side information. For achieving hierarchical sparsity patterns in parameters, we investigate the differences between group lasso (GL) and latent overlapping group lasso (LOG) in terms of their statistical properties and computational efficiency. We highlight a phenomenon of GL in which parameters embedded deep within the DAG are more aggressively regularized than those that are less deeply embedded. By contrast, we show that using LOG fulfills our goal without any additional complication and performs, both in practice and in theory, very similarly to the GL penalty that is modified to curb its over-aggressiveness. In terms of computation, we derive a finite-step algorithm for the proximal operator of LOG in the case of the DAG being a directed path graph; we later exploit this efficiency to propose a novel path-based block coordinate descent scheme. Finally, we compare the two frameworks in estimating banded covariance matrix, where we introduce a new sparsely-banded estimator using LOG, which we show achieves the statistical advantages of an existing GL-based method but is simpler to express and more efficient to compute.  Another kind of sparsity we care about is sparsity in the data itself. It is prevalent to have many highly sparse features for counting frequency of rare events in diverse areas, ranging from natural language processing (e.g., rare words) to biology (e.g., rare species). We show, both theoretically and empirically, that not explicitly accounting for the rareness of features can greatly reduce the effectiveness of an analysis. We propose a tree-guided framework for aggregating rare features into denser ones through solving a convex optimization problem. The tree, which encodes feature similarity information on the leaves, comes from prior knowledge or data sources external to the current problem and is used as side information in aggregation. In our proposal, aggregating rare features is equivalent as enforcing equal coefficients within each group learned from solving the convex problem, resulting in another case of structural pattern in parameters. We apply our method on two data sets: a TripAdvisor hotel review data set, in which we predict the numerical rating of a hotel based on the text of an associated review; and a microbiome data set from the American Gut project that measures microbial species abundance from fecal samples, in which we predict the one's BMI based on both microbiome and non-microbiome features. In both applications, our method achieves high accuracy by making effective use of rare features and yields more interpretable results.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:44:46Z (GMT).

However, due to the diffraction-limit of light, achieving the 10 ‚Äì 100 nanometer spatial resolution and 10 ‚Äì 100 picosecond temporal resolution required to image these phenomena is beyond the reach of table-top techniques.  My dissertation research has been to develop stroboscopic magnetic microscopy techniques that use picosecond thermal gradients to transduce magnetization into a voltage. In magnetic metals, this is accomplished via the anomalous Nernst effect and in ferromagnetic insulator/heavy metal bilayers the signal is due to the longitudinal spin Seebeck effect detected via the inverse spin Hall effect. Using focused, 3 ps laser pulses to heat cobalt and permalloy films, I demonstrate that the anomalous Nernst effect can image magnetization with 10-100 ps temporal resolution, sub-micron spatial resolution, and sensitivity to the in-plane moment of 0.1¬∞/‚àöHz. I then show how this sensitivity and resolution can be applied for phase-sensitive ferromagnetic resonance imaging in ultrathin YIG/Pt bilayers in which we observe spatial variation of the resonance field, amplitude, phase, and linewidth. To conclude, I present the development of a near-field scanning optical microscope to create nanoscale thermal gradients and achieve spatial resolution of magnetic textures below the diffraction limit. The advent of these far- and near-field magneto-thermal imaging techniques will enable the table-top measurement of nanoscale magnetization dynamics in thin film devices.

It primarily presents second harmonic Hall technique measurements with an in-plane magnetic sensor layer that demonstrate that the spin polarization of such spin currents orients itself parallel to the magnetization of the generating layer. Hence the work demonstrates that one can control the spin polarization of spin currents generated in this way, such that torques may be actively reoriented during measurement by controlling the magnetization of the generating layer. By these measurements, this work also estimates the spin torque efficiency of the alloy of iron and gadolinium used for this measurement to be about 1%. This dissertation then discusses ongoing measurements using the spin torque ferromagnetic resonance technique modified by application of a DC bias current to characterize the size of the anomalous Hall spin torque efficiency in a cobalt holmium alloy and several other materials. The author presents related ongoing efforts with additional experimental techniques to understand and utilize the anomalous Hall spin current effectively. This work also discusses practical applications for reorientable spin torques.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:44:47Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The first presents a new auction mechanism designed for conservation programs. Individuals compensated for conserving their land often extract substantial profits from the government or non-governmental agency funding the conservation program. These rents limit the amount of land which can be conserved, which decreases total surplus for society. The new auction mechanism, the Provision Point Reverse Auction, was designed to mitigate this rent-seeking behavior. This paper presents both theoretical and experimental evidence to substantiate the efficacy of the mechanism. The second chapter considers the effect that preference uncertainty may have on two commonly observed behavioral anomalies: exchange asymmetries and the willingness-to-accept/willingness-to-pay disparity. This paper provides both theoretical and experimental evidence which suggests that uncertainty in preferences can explain at least part of these behavioral anomalies. The experiments rely on chocolate and a ``taste'' treatment, where individuals in a treatment group are allowed to taste a small amount of chocolate before making their trade or valuation decisions.		2/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:44:48Z (GMT).

To examine what physical classroom elements high school students perceive would promote collaboration, 2. To examine the influence these physical classroom elements have on collaboration. Methods: This research was conducted in two studies: study I, a structured photographic Q-sort (N = 46), study II, a quasi-experiment (N = 24).  Study I: students examined 30 photos and determined which physical elements they preferred for the promotion of collaboration. Study II: based on the results from study I, a collaborative classroom was created. Researchers analyzed the differences in aspects of collaborative work in a collaborative design versus a traditional design.  Results: Students identified which physical elements they preferred for collaboration. Type of room influenced how students perceived their collaboration via group dynamics, personal experience, and impact of the physical environment.  Conclusions: Physical classroom design influences student collaborative work. Further research should be conducted to examine these results long term.

This dissertation introduces a theory of networked cleavage articulation that explains this variation in party system reconstruction outcomes. This theory posits that the social network structures within which nascent parties emerge condition the articulation of social cleavages in the party system and define the extent to which cleavages become associated with party system consolidation or increased political instability.  The dissertation employs original interviews, surveys, and electoral data to evaluate this theory through a mixed-methods approach. It offers three central findings. First, it demonstrates that social cleavages can consistently structure political behavior and nonetheless be associated with various party system outcomes, from consolidation to social conflict. I show that, ethnic cleavages in Bolivia and Peru have structured political behavior since their democratic transitions and throughout major party system transformations. Second, the dissertation demonstrates that the degree of cleavage articulation explains variation in party system reconstruction outcomes. In Bolivia, the MAS-IPSP produced a successful articulation of the indigenous bloc of the ethnic cleavage, enabling partial party system reconstruction. In contrast, political parties‚Äô articulation offers for the non-indigenous in Bolivia and both the indigenous and non-indigenous in Peru have thus far failed. Consequently, these ethnic blocs remain associated with political instability.  Finally, this dissertation shows that the likelihood of cleavage articulation is conditioned by nascent parties‚Äô original network landscapes. I find that, in contrast to other indigenous and non-indigenous parties in Bolivia and Peru, which have emerged from networks with regional strength and limited paths to expansion, the MAS-IPSP emerged within a vast organizational landscape that provided it with diverse within-network paths to growth and enabled it to produce a successful indigenous bloc articulation.  This dissertation challenges current understanding of the relationship between social cleavages and party systems. By bringing attention to the challenges of cleavage articulation, its likelihood of failure, and the role of social networks in this process, the dissertation introduces new and important insights to existing literature on social cleavages, political representation, and party politics.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:44:50Z (GMT).

Activation of Arf (ADP-ribosylation factor) GTPases is essential for vesicle formation via recruitment of cargo adaptors and coat proteins necessary for Golgi trafficking. Arf activation is spatially and temporally regulated by distinct guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) at different Golgi compartments. The yeast Arf-GEF Sec7 is a conserved and essential activator of Arf1 at the trans-Golgi network. Sec7 is composed of seven domains. The N-terminal domains, Dimerization and Cyclophilin Binding and Homology Upstream of Sec7 Domains (DCB-HUS), have been implicated in homodimerization, recruitment to the Golgi, and stimulation of GEF activity. The C-terminal domains, Homology Downstream of Sec7 Domain (HDS1-4), are necessary for autoinhibition, recruitment to the Golgi, and allosteric activation. However, the function of a highly conserved N-terminal region referred to as the HUS-box has not been determined.  In this work, I report that mutation of the HUS box compromises Sec7 activity on membranes in vitro and is lethal in vivo. I discovered that the cause of this phenotype is disruption of the positive feedback and allosteric activation of Sec7 by the GTPase Ypt31, a yeast Rab11 homolog. These results support a model in which the inter- and intramolecular interactions of the HUS box and the C terminus are necessary for the allosteric activation of Sec7. I demonstrate that the established role of the N-terminal region in dimerization is not conserved; instead, a C-terminal autoinhibitory domain is responsible for dimerization of Sec7. Based on unpublished data, I propose that additional regions of Sec7 are responsible for its regulation and suggest future experiments to help decipher additional regulatory mechanisms of Sec7.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:44:51Z (GMT).

Two essays focus on the topic of income taxes, in particular, income-tax salience and income-tax perceptions, and how these differ for federal vs. state income taxes. These perceptions have potential implications for optimal policy design and labor-supply decisions. The third essay uses a novel approach to examine potential nonresponse bias in large government surveys that are a frequent source of economics data. In Chapter 1, I examine income-tax salience. Income taxes distort labor market outcomes, sometimes as a primary goal (as in the earned income tax credit) and sometimes as a secondary consequence (as a by-product of raising revenue). However, for an individual‚Äôs decisions to be influenced by a tax, he needs to be incorporating it in his decision-making. If the source of the tax--e.g., the state or federal government--affects the consumer‚Äôs awareness of the tax in his decisionmaking, then different income taxes might have different labor-market effects. This chapter provides experimental survey evidence that state taxes are less salient than federal taxes. Reduced-form estimates show a large difference between state and federal taxes. Direct estimation of salience parameters in a preferred subsample indicates that federal income taxes are close to fully salient, while state income taxes are substantially and significantly less salient. The chapter also explores evidence for individual-level explanations of salience and tax knowledge.  In Chapter 2, I examine income-tax perceptions. Income taxes are complicatedand potentially confusing to consumers. Individuals may rely on heuristics or make systematic mistakes in their perceptions of their taxes. This chapter uses experimental survey data to add to a literature seeking to understand federal income-tax perceptions and adds novel evidence on state income-tax perceptions. I find broad agreement in perceptions between state and federal income taxes. Generally, individuals perceive too much progressivity in both federal and state tax schedules. Estimating a model of federal tax perceptions yields results consistent with a more complicated mental model than suggested in previous literature.  In Chapter 3, we examine nonresponse bias in large government surveys. Economists are often interested in measuring outcomes such as unemployment, labor force participation, obesity, and household expenditures. In this chapter we study the sources of the relevant official statistics|the Current Population Survey (CPS), the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), and the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX)|and find that measurements of these outcomes depend on whether we look at easy vs. difficult-to-reach respondents. These results empirically substantiate the theoretical warning against making population-wide estimates from surveys with low response rates.

Previous findings show that comprehension is optimized when information presentation aligns with the cognitive abilities and preferences of an individual. On the other hand, the possession of field knowledge has also been studied to influence learning outcome and perception. This paper aims to understand the effects of individual‚Äôs information processing styles and field knowledge on design decision-making, specifically focusing on designer learning and user experience. Two distinct decision support systems interfaces were developed to better examine the effect using a mixed model design. A total of 48 college students participated in the quantitative study and interacted with the two different interfaces of a satellite design system in a randomized order. Then a representative subset of data samples was selected for further qualitative analysis. Results show significant impacts of field knowledge and visual processing style on learning and user experience as well as behavioral differences between different user groups. Potential interaction effects with the design support system interface type and cognitive styles were also observed.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:44:53Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Mueller, Erich||Ralph, Daniel C.	2018-10-22T18:44:54Z			8/30/18		In this thesis, I summarize my research on the generation of spin current via the spin Hall effect (SHE) in various material systems, the behaviors of the spin-orbit torques (SOTs) which result from the injection of spin current into an adjacent ferromagnet (FM) in the thin film heterostructures under different interfacial and ambient conditions, the engineering of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) at the FM/oxide interface, and how to use this effect together with the large SOTs to manipulate the magnetic moment in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Accordingly, the thesis consists of four sections for the experimental details regarding the above aspects.  In the first study, I focused on the behavior of the SOTs generated in normal metal (NM)/FM/oxide heterostructures under different interfacial and ambient conditions. By varying the spin current sources and controlling the different interfaces, the strength of the SOTs can be efficiently modified, pointing out the physical origins and mechanism of the generation and transfer of these SOTs in the NM/FM/oxide heterostructures. In the second study, I explored the SHE in various material systems beyond conventional heavy metals. These material systems include antiferromagnetic alloys and ferromagnetic alloys near the magnetic transition temperatures. By employing spin torque ferromagnetic resonance and the harmonic response technique, I was able to quantify the strength of the SHE in those material systems under both room temperature and low temperature ambient conditions. In the third part, I explained the discovery and manipulation of the PMA at the FM/oxide interface by inserting an ultrathin metallic dusting layer. I demonstrated that with this dusting technique, the PMA can be greatly enhanced and efficiently modified by the types of the dusting material, the amount of that material, and the post-fabrication process involving the dusting layer. In the last part, I showed that by combing the strong SHE in the heavy metal tungsten (W) and the PMA effect from the dusting technique, MTJs with fast, reliable switching and low switching current can be realized in three-terminal nanoscale devices, demonstrating their great potential as a building block for the next generation memory storage elements.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:44:54Z (GMT).

Currently, it is the most effective long-term treatment for obesity and results in multiple cardiometabolic benefits. However, the mechanisms by which these benefits occur remain incompletely defined. In order to identify these mechanisms our lab has developed and validated a murine model of vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), a type of a bariatric surgery. This model recapitulates many of the changes observed in humans after VSG. These include body weight loss, decreases in food intake, decreases in adiposity, improved glucose homeostasis, improved glucose stimulated insulin secretion, increases in post-prandial glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion, changes in the bile acid pool/profile, and remission of hypertension. Utilizing this model we have investigated the role of Œ≤-cell glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) signaling in the glucoregulatory benefits of VSG and have also explored the effect of VSG on colitis development.    One of the most remarkable changes seen after VSG is high rates of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) remission. This remission occurs hours to days after surgery, prior to significant body weight loss, and the mechanisms by which this occurs remain incompletely defined. The mechanisms that cause remission of T2DM are thought to be multi-factorial. One of these mechanisms is thought to involve increases in endogenous postprandial GLP-1 secretion, which has been shown to occur after multiple types of bariatric surgery. GLP-1R signaling is important for a variety of functions including the potentiation of glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), enhancement of insulin sensitivity, and decreases in appetite. Given the known role of Œ≤-cell GLP-1R signaling in the potentiation of GSIS we investigated its role in the glucoregulatory benefits of VSG utilizing an inducible Œ≤-cell GLP-1R mouse model. Utilizing this model, we defined the effect of increased endogenous GLP-1 signaling via Œ≤-cell GLP-1R on increases in GSIS, improvements in glucose tolerance, body weight loss in mice after VSG, and the following in pancreatic islets: insulin, glucagon, GLP-1, and prohormone convertase 1/3 (Chapters Two and Three). A growing number of people suffering from irritable bowel disease (IBD) also suffer from obesity and are candidates for bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery has multiple beneficial effects, however; there is limited and conflicting literature on the effect of bariatric surgery on IBD. In order to investigate this we performed VSG in mice and chemically induced colitis with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) three weeks after surgery (Chapter Four). The present dissertation describes the contributions of Œ≤-cell GLP-1R signaling in the glucoregulatory benefits of VSG surgery; demonstrates Œ≤-cell GLP-1R signaling is a novel regulator of Œ±-cell proglucagon processing after VSG; and demonstrates VSG surgery aggravates colitis in mice. The knowledge gained from this research is novel and serves as an anchor for further elucidating the mechanisms by which VSG surgery improves conditions such as T2DM but exacerbates conditions such as IBD.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:44:54Z (GMT).

They also play vital roles maintaining homologous recombination fidelity during repair of double strand breaks in DNA, by preventing dissimilar sequences from undergoing recombination, a process known as heteroduplex rejection. I showed that maintaining proper levels of MMR proteins is vital for the optimal function of a variety of genome stability pathways. Using a single strand annealing recombination assay that is not linked to DNA replication, I found that mild overexpression of the MMR protein Msh6 improved the efficiency of heteroduplex rejection by compromising Msh2-Msh3 function in the removal of 3‚Äô non-homologous tails, which is a critical intermediate in this recombination pathway. Importantly, I also showed that 3‚Äô tail clipping acts as a critical temporal commitment step during heteroduplex rejection. In contrast to the above observation where overexpression of Msh6 improved recombination fidelity, mild overexpression of Msh6 compromised heteroduplex rejection in an inverted repeat recombination assay that is thought to occur during DNA replication.  This disruption occurred through interactions with the replication processivity clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and involved the sequestration of Sgs1, a critical component of the rejection machinery. Importantly, co-overexpression of the Msh2-Msh6 complex caused a variety of genomic instabilities by interacting with PCNA and likely disrupting replication fork functions. These instability phenotypes included increased rates of homologous recombination, increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents such as methyl methanesulfonate, hydroxyurea and 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide, increased loss of heterozygosity, and increased mutation rates. Thus, it is crucial that MMR proteins are maintained at appropriate levels in order to maintain genome stability. Misregulation of the levels of MMR proteins has been observed in multiple cancers; my work provides insights for how overexpression of MMR proteins can play an important role in cancer progression.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:44:55Z (GMT).

Urban planners have thus long been interested in the determinants of housing quality and ability of policy to influence the physical condition of housing stock. In this dissertation, I examine three questions related to the physical quality of housing in the United States. In my first essay, I study whether and through what channels deteriorating housing in Cleveland, OH impacts the neighborhoods in which it is located. In my second essay, I study whether regulations which constrain the development of new housing affect the prevalence of certain housing problems. Finally, in my last essay, I examine various ways in which families alter the quality of housing they consume in the face of high housing prices and limited supply. My research contributes to both our academic understanding of how housing markets function and provides insights for planners and policy makers as they develop policy to improve housing quality in their communities.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:44:56Z (GMT).

This includes applications in solar cells, field effect transistors, thermoelectric generators, chemical sensors, and electrochemical cells. One application of intense promise is using silicon and germanium nanowires as anodes materials in lithium ion batteries, as these materials form stable compounds with superior lithium capacity that increases the anode charge capacity compared to current Li-ion batteries by a factor of 4 - 10. Unlike the bulk material, nanowires have been demonstrated to withstand the >400% volume dilation due to the intercalation of lithium. To bring the acclaimed potential of nanowires to fruition, challenges in production, scaling, and electrochemical performance must be resolved. Conventional nanowire synthesis methods produce small yields of nanowires that require many processes (i.e., slurry mixing, coating, baking) to introduce into batteries. To meet the growing energy storage demands for personal electronics and electric vehicles, an improved method is required to produce nanowires. In this dissertation, I will introduce a growth mechanism that is simple, robust, and adaptable to high throughput processing of nucleating and growing nanowires from bulk metal films, known as bulk nucleated vapor-solid-solid (BN-VSS). This method prepares nanowires that are epitaxially connected to the metal substrate, allowing direct integration into batteries. I identify the kinetic conditions required to grow nanowires, the processes that occur during nanowire growth, and copper as a promising growth substrate material. Then, I will present a kinetic model of germanium nanowire growth from copper films using DPG as a precursor. This model was developed by performing rapid syntheses of nanowires using an inductive heating apparatus followed by ex-situ characterization of these films. Then, I introduce a diagnostic technique of measuring the electrical resistance of the growth substrate to monitor the solid-state transformation that proceeds to germanium nanowire growth and demonstrate how this method can be used to inform kinetic conditions in high-throughput roll-to-roll (R2R) reactors. In the remaining chapters of this dissertation I will introduce preliminary efforts in the areas of R2R reactions, battery testing, kinetics of silicon nanowires, and analysis of the different growth interfaces of Bulk-nucleated VSS growth.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:44:58Z (GMT).

Here, we will present our investigations on the thin-film growth of tetracene, a polyaromatic hydrocarbon, whose simple structure belies the complex nature of growth revealed by synchrotron X-ray scattering.  Although tetracene is structurally very similar to pentacene, we find that the nature of the thin-film growth on SiO2 of tetracene is quite different from that of pentacene.  At a substrate temperature of T_s ~ 30 ¬∞C, we observe two unusual phenomena.  First, using in situ X-ray reflectivity at the anti-Bragg condition, we observe a transition from 3D island growth to 2D layer-by-layer growth of tetracene as the growth rate is increased.  We use ex situ atomic force microscopy to determine that upward transport drives 3D island growth.  The transition from 3D growth to 2D growth occurs when the rate of admolecule attachment at the tetracene island/SiO2 substrate edges, which is related to growth rate, effectively outcompetes the rate of upward step-edge transport.  Second, using in situ grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, we observe a transition from growth of only a thin-film phase to growth of a bulk phase.  We observe that the bulk phase appears at lower thickness and that there is a lower contribution of the thin-film phase for slower growth rate than for faster growth rates.  This is due to significant reorganization at slower growth rates, resulting in molecules traversing upwards on islands and escaping the influence of the substrate and relaxing into the bulk phase.  Furthermore, we find that at T_s ~ 0 ¬∞C, the transition from 3D to 2D growth occurs at a much lower growth rate than at T_s ~ 30 ¬∞C, and we observe a lack of evidence for bulk-phase growth.  This suggests that the rate of upward transport is suppressed at lower temperatures.  Finally, we find that even by matching the surface energy of the substrate (with a pre-deposited layer of pentacene) and tetracene, there is still significant upward transport, although there is less than on pristine SiO2.

Cultivars are hybrids between two autopolyploid species, the domesticated "noble cane" Saccharum officinarum L. (2n=80) and the wild Saccharum spontaneum L. (2n=40-128). In this study genomic selection was evaluated as a tool to increase efficiency in the breeding program. A population of 1882 clones from two breeding cycles was genotyped by sequencing resulting in a filtered set of 55k SNPs, providing extensive genome coverage. This population was phenotyped for plot weight, Brix, fiber and sucrose content, with replicated measurements taken on first season crop and ratoon crop harvests. Broad-sense heritabilities ranged from 0.69 to 0.90. Genomic prediction accuracy was assessed with genomic best linear unbiased prediction models in two ways: for clonal prediction of the genotyped clones and for parental prediction of their respective progenitors. In clonal prediction accuracies ranged from 0.07 to 0.39 in cross validation within a breeding cycle, and 0.01 to 0.32 in predictions across cycles. In parental prediction accuracies varied from 0.14 to 0.17 for Brix, and from 0.20 to 0.26 for plot weight. We observed a strong genotype by year interaction effect leading to reduced accuracies when predicting across breeding cycles. The genomic predicted breeding value using progeny data, achieved similar accuracies as clonal prediction. These results could be taken into account in the deployment of genomic selection for a sugarcane breeding program. We also investigated the use of high dosage information in the representation of SNP data from sugarcane. Association analysis and genomic prediction were performed using four fiber traits, for a countinuous marker representation that can represent high dosage of alleles, and for a discrete representation, that is limited in distinguishing heterozygous from homozygous states. We observed an increase in the number of significant hits in association tests when using dosage coding. In genomic prediction, differences were small between continuous and discrete coding, but in most of the cases there was an advantage when using continuous coding.

Ch.1 argues that the notion of a contrary-to-duty (CTD) obligation and its role in normative discourse and reasoning are not adequately captured in the standard semantics for ought-statements, developed by Angelika Kratzer and David Lewis. I show this by presenting a new puzzle, the CTD Trilemma, using a famous example from Chisholm‚Äôs Paradox. I claim that two different roles played by ought-statements in normative discourse and reasoning have to be captured in any satisfactory semantic account for normative language. I draw the distinction between axiological and deontological ought-statements in my version of deontic update semantics and how this distinction nicely solves the puzzles about CTD obligations.  Ch.2 discusses the challenge that the possibility of moral dilemmas poses to the ordering semantic account of ought-statements. I critically discuss and compare the advantages and disadvantages of two ordering semantic analyses of ought-statements when it comes to moral dilemmas: the conflict and disjunctive accounts. I conclude that in order to adequately describe one‚Äôs normative predicament and reasoning in a dilemma situation, two kinds of ought-statements defined by the two accounts have to be captured in a single semantic framework. And, I show how it can be done in the ordering semantic framework.  Ch.3 critically evaluates the real force of the Disagreement-Based Argument (DBA) in metaethics, exemplified by R.M. Hare‚Äôs cannibals argument and Horgan and Timmons‚Äô Moral Twin Earth argument. I analyze the structure of the DBA and defuse its direct threat to descriptivism by disproving its most problematic assumption : that genuine disagreement between two parties requires that the parties agree in what they mean by the key terms in the dispute. I argue that the disagreement data the DBA elicits from thought experiments does not put real pressure on descriptivism, because the proponents of descriptivism can explain the data away by showing how two different linguistic communities can genuinely disagree about what to do and how to live.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:00Z (GMT).

Cancellous bone is the primary load-bearing structure of human vertebral bodies, yet most studies of cancellous bone mechanical performance concentrate on uniaxial properties such as Young's modulus and strength. Mechanical properties of cancellous bone are caused by the accumulation of microdamage, local stress and strain, tissue material properties, and local geometry. In this thesis, I examine the mechanisms associated with fatigue failure of cancellous bone. I then apply the findings to the design of novel microarchitectured materials. To examine the mechanical performance of cancellous bone under fatigue, we submitted human vertebral cancellous bone to cyclic compressive loading to induce microdamage. We found that fatigue failure is caused primarily by the initial sites of microdamage accumulation. In cancellous bone, microdamage formed preferentially in the interior regions of trabeculae, distant from trabecular surfaces. The location of microdamage coincided with locations of greater concentrations of Advanced Glycation Products (AGEs), suggesting the interior regions of trabeculae are more brittle and susceptible to microdamage accumulation. Because local geometry influences failure of cancellous bone, we examined the microarchitectual features of cancellous bone that are associated with damage accumulation. We found that microdamage accumulation in cancellous bone was reduced in specimens with thicker transverse rod-like trabeculae. Early in fatigue life, disproportionately more rod-like trabeculae failed, suggesting the importance of transverse rod-like trabeculae in resisting fatigue failure. To further test the idea that rod-like trabeculae influenced fatigue failure, models of cancellous bone were generated using three-dimensional printing in which transverse rod thickness was increased in a controlled manner. The specimens were submitted to cyclic compressive loading. Increasing the thickness of transverse rod-like trabeculae substantially extended fatigue life. Next, we designed a repeating cellular solid that also demonstrates enhanced fatigue life due to alterations in transverse struts. In summary, both tissue material properties and microarchitecture of cancellous bone influence fatigue failure. Our findings suggest a previously unidentified design strategy of open cell foams in which the strut thickness transverse to loads determines fatigue life. The resulting low-density cellular structure has potential application in a variety of lightweight structures.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:00Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

First, we give a novel proof of the fact that, for a fixed graph $G$ with heat semigroup generator $P$ and measure $m$, the following are equivalent: (1) $(G,P,m)$ satisfies volume doubling and the Poincar\'e inequality; (2) the heat kernel on $(G,P,m)$ satisfies two-sided Gaussian bounds; and (3) solutions to the heat equation on $(G,P,m)$ satisfy the Harnack inequality. This useful equivalence---which connects two geometric conditions to stochastic bounds---was first shown in the continuous case by L. Saloff-Coste and A. Grigor'yan and later, in the discrete case, by T. Delmotte. Our proof avoids complications of previous discrete proof. Given a graph $(G,P,m)$ that satisfies the three equivalent conditions above, which subgraphs $U \subseteq G$ also satisfy these conditions? We prove that $(U,P_N,m)$ does, where $U$ is an inner uniform domain and $P_N$ is the Neumann heat semigroup. Then, we prove that $(U,P_h,m_{h^2})$ does, where $U$ is an inner uniform domain and $P_h$ is the heat semigroup obtained through Doob's $h$-transformation. The kernel for $P_h$ is directly related to the kernel for $P_D$, the heat semigroup on $U$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions, and therefore, we are able to derive bounds for the Dirichlet heat kernel in inner uniform domains. All work in this thesis is joint with Laurent Saloff-Coste.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:01Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

At the same time, millions of acres of U.S. agricultural land became attractive for energy development due to the shale gas revolution and rising demand for utility-scale solar and wind power. To its supporters, energy development on agricultural land is a win-win proposition, offering land-rich but cash-poor farm owners a new stream of income and, potentially, the means to relieve credit constraints and reinvest in their farms. Critics, however, fret that turning productive farmland over to gas wells and solar panels will contribute to long-term loss of agricultural land and raise the costs of farming in areas attractive for energy development. At the crux of this debate are two still-unanswered or partially answered empirical questions: (1) what are the characteristics of farm businesses that choose to participate in energy leases and (2) what is the impact of energy leases on the long-term viability of host farms? This study uses national survey data from the USDA's 2014 Tenure, Ownership, and Transition of Agricultural Land (TOTAL) survey to shed new light on these issues. This large, rich, cross sectional data set provides an unprecedented perspective on farm financial behavior. In addition to detailed household and farm production characteristics, TOTAL collected detailed data on energy lease participation and income. Further, TOTAL included questions on whether a farm had difficulty accessing credit and made any capital or land investments. TOTAL contains other information not typically included in ARMS that may otherwise be unobservable, such as time to intended retirement or transition and a risk preferences score. This study uses stratified propensity score matching (PSM) to assess the impact of energy leases on participating farm businesses' capital investment, net income, and credit constraints. The TOTAL data set is exceptionally well-suited to analysis using PSM, allowing us to mitigate selection bias arising from systematic differences in the observable characteristics of farms that do and do not host energy projects. We can also contrast impacts associated with leasing oil or gas rights compared with other types of on-farm leases (for example hunting and renewable energy leases). Our results suggest that energy production income is of minor importance to most of the farms that receive it. In particular, there is no evidence of an impact on credit constraints; farms with energy income were no more or less likely to report difficulty borrowing. We also found no significant effects on the amount of capital spending or overall net farm income. That said, farms with energy income were significantly more likely to report some capital investment (of any amount) and were significantly less likely to have negative net farm income.

However, serious challenges to its use exist, including a lack of high reflectivity mirror components. Distributed Bragg Reflectors (DBRs) offer some of the most efficient mirrors available in this range. These one dimensional photonic crystals can be grown epitaxially on existing deep UV optical devices within the same growth chamber, making them easy to integrate with existing designs to potentially improve light extraction efficiency. Serious challenges still exist with the use of AlGaN DBRs, including the low contrast of the material system and difficulty of consistent crystal growth. 		 	The design of AlGaN DBRs is approached from initial principles based on the optical simulation of these DBRs using the 1D transfer matrix method combined with existing models of the optical parameters of AlGaN films. Exotic approaches such as porous films are also included in the models to expand the range of design parameters. Design rules of thumb based on analysis of these simulations are used to simplify design choices into a systematic approach. Finally, the growth of AlGaN DBRs using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and optical and structural characterization methods are introduced."		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:01Z (GMT).

In many real-world problems, the underlying model is unknown and possibly stochastic. Therefore, it is not possible to optimize actions using analytical methods. The goal of online learning is to learn from past observations as quickly as possible to minimize the loss that results from not knowing the true underlying model. Since uncertainty plays a big role in power system operations and power consumption, it makes optimizing actions a very challenging task for participants of wholesale electricity markets. This results in various interesting problems that requires an online learning approach. Motivated by two different applications in electricity markets, we study two different online learning problems. 	 We first study the problem of online learning and optimization of unknown Markov jump affine models which is motivated by the dynamic pricing problem of an electricity retailer. An online learning policy, referred to as Markovian simultaneous perturbations stochastic approximation (MSPSA), is proposed for two different optimization objectives: (i) the quadratic cost minimization of the regulation problem and (ii) the revenue (profit) maximization problem. It is shown that MSPSA is an order optimal learning policy in terms of regret growth rate. More specifically, the regret of MSPSA grows at the order of the square root of the learning horizon, and the regret of any policy grows no slower than that of MSPSA.  Furthermore, it is also shown that the MSPSA policy converges to the optimal control input almost surely as well as in the mean square sense. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the regret growth rate of MSPSA and to show that MSPSA can offer significant gain over the greedy certainty equivalent approach. Motivated by virtual trading in two-settlement wholesale electricity markets, the second problem we consider is the online learning problem of optimal bidding strategy in repeated multi-commodity auctions. A polynomial-time online learning algorithm is proposed to maximize the cumulative payoff over a finite horizon by allocating the bidder's budget among his bids for K options in each period. The proposed algorithm, referred to as dynamic programming on discrete set (DPDS), achieves a regret order of O(‚àö(T log‚Å°T) ). By showing that the regret is lower bounded by Œ©(‚àöT) for any strategy, we conclude that DPDS is order optimal up to a ‚àölog‚Å°T term. Our result also implies that the expected payoff of DPDS converges, with an almost optimal convergence rate, to the expected payoff of the global optimal corresponding to the case when the underlying model is known. By using both cumulative payoff and Sharpe ratio as performance metrics, evaluations were performed based on historical data spanning ten year period of NYISO and PJM energy markets. It was shown that the proposed strategy outperforms standard benchmarks and the S&P 500 index over the same period."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:02Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In mammals, these differences have been linked to processes in both the innate and adaptive immune responses, and many autoimmune disorders (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disease) show a bias towards developing in females. However, the complex mechanisms behind these discrepancies are not fully understood. CD8+ T-cells are a subtype of lymphocytes that are critical to the production of and response to inflammatory signaling, so they are likely to play a role in these autoinflammatory processes. Previous work in murine na√Øve CD8+ T-cells has shown that na√Øve female CD8+ T-cells follow different patterns of differentiation after antigen exposure than male CD8+ T-cells. Both sexes form the same number of differentiated cells, but the ratio of T-cell subsets formed differs between males and females. Female CD8+ T-cells tend to differentiate into short-lived effector cells (SLECs) that respond directly to invaders and produce large amounts of inflammatory cytokines, while their male counterparts tend to differentiate into memory precursor effector cells (MPECs) that respond less directly to infection but can transition into the pool of cells that forms immunological memory. Co-transfer experiments and assays of T-cell function suggest that this altered differentiation may be cell intrinsic, as opposed to being a product of different niches between males and females. To investigate the potential genomic factors driving sex specific differences in CD8+  T-cell differentiation, I performed RNA-seq and PRO-seq on na√Øve male and female CD8+ cells. These data revealed a potential role for the Type I Interferon response and the related transcription factor IRF7 in the differentiation of female na√Øve CD8+ T-cells. Future investigations will be required to elucidate the exact mechanism of this differential expression of the Type I IFN pathway.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:03Z (GMT).

In HTL experiments, aqueous product samples were collected at different reaction times, separated by vacuum filtration, and analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Exponentially Modified Gaussian (EMG) model was applied to fitting the HPLC curves of the standards under different concentrations. The EMG model corresponded well with each curve with mean percent error (MPE) values less than 3%. Overlapping HPLC signals were observed and resolved computationally using the superposition of EMG functions. To simulate HTL reaction kinetics, various reaction pathway schemes were proposed based on the experimental findings. Best-fit reaction kinetic parameters were derived from an optimization of the errors of reaction kinetic modeling. The reaction kinetics will help entrepreneurs and researchers optimally produce selective commodity biochemical from waste biomass to provide alternatives to the petrochemical industry.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:03Z (GMT).

However, in many settings, the decision-maker may be interested in multiple performance metrics. Take, for instance, the problem of assigning cross-trained hospital staff to  two classes of patients: low-priority and high-priority. In the typical framework, this problem could be modelled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), in which the performance metric to be minimized is a weighted combination of expected waiting times for each class. However, we argue that a more natural approach is to consider the constrained problem: minimizing the expected waiting time for lower priority patients, while keeping that of higher priority patients under a given target, $V$. In particular, we concern ourselves with uncovering structural properties of this problem. These properties imply the existence of simple optimal policies that are easy to implement in practice.  We formulate this problem (the parallel setting), as well as a related problem in which customers undergo two phases of service in series (the tandem setting), as Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs). We present a general framework for solving two-class CMDPs, showing that they can be solved by using the Lagrangian dual to specify a particular unconstrained problem. If an appropriate Lagrange multiplier can be discerned, structural results from the resulting Lagrangian relaxation can be used to exploit structure in the original CMDP. We show that for both the parallel and tandem settings, the framework leads to simple threshold-like optimal policies. The results in each case are used to develop heuristics for analogous problems with abandonments with applications to healthcare, call centers and manufacturing systems. The efficacy of the heuristics are verified in each case via a detailed numerical study. We then extend the results in the parallel case to handle multiple classes and constraints. Lastly, we consider a controlled, truncated birth-death chain motivated by optimal treatment prescription in the context of personalized medicine. In this model, states represent the patient's state of health, and treatments can be prescribed to influence improvement and/or deterioration of health. The problem of dynamically prescribing treatments at minimal cost while maintaining a given level of health is modelled as a two-cost CMDP. Rather than employing the more general methods developed earlier, we decompose the state space and consider an alternative Lagrangian relaxation involving two simpler subproblems. We obtain structural results for this problem by showing that optimal solutions to these subproblems can be combined into a constrained-optimal policy. We then attempt to find conditions under which a monotone optimal policy exists under more general transition rates between states of health.

This is particularly the case in natural language processing (NLP), where the discrete, compositional nature of words and sentences leads to natural combinatorial representations such as trees, sequences, segments, or alignments, among others. It is no surprise that structured output models have been successful and popular in NLP applications since their inception. At the same time, deep, hierarchical neural networks with latent representations are increasingly widely and successfully applied to language tasks. As compositions of differentiable building blocks, deep models conventionally perform smooth, soft computations, resulting in dense hidden representations. In this work, we focus on models with structure and sparsity in both their outputs as well as their latent representations, without sacrificing differentiability for end-to-end gradient-based training. We develop methods for sparse and structured attention mechanisms, for differentiable sparse structure inference, for latent neural network structure, and for sparse structured output prediction. We find our methods to be empirically useful on a wide range of applications including sentiment analysis, natural language inference, neural machine translation, sentence compression, and argument mining.

This fined tuned control allows us to reprogram organisms with sophisticated synthetic behaviors such as producing vital chemicals and drugs and sensing environmental signals. In order to do this we need libraries of highly efficient genetic regulators and proven methods of combining them into networks. RNA presents the ideal tool to build new genetic networks because its structural and temporal characteristics allow engineers to construct fast, designable genetic networks. In this work, we show characterization and optimization of new and existing RNA regulators as well as efforts to create new behaviors with RNA-based genetic networks. We begin by vastly improving the dynamic range of an existing transcriptional RNA regulator, the pT181 attenuator, by adding translational regulation. This dual control attenuator is successfully used to reduce circuit leak in an RNA-only cascade. In order to expand upon the functionality of the RNA repressors, we design sequesters that allow us to dial down repression. The sequestration effectively creates a threshold which we use to tune the relationship between the input and output of a system. As we construct more complex circuits with diverse parts, modularity becomes essential in order to predict circuit behavior. We explore the modularity of our RNA regulators in combination with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) interference (CRISPRi) in construction of an RNA pulse generator. Finally, we explore the design and implementation two complex circuits: a communication network for delivering complex signals to cells and a control network to reduce noise in biological systems. We anticipate that the design rules learned and the tools developed here will allow construction of even more sophisticated behaviors as the growing discipline of genetic design matures.

Drawing on survey data from more than 488 rideshare drivers and 75 interviews, this dissertation suggests that the relationship between workers in the gig economy and their platforms has manifest impact on their work behaviors. Drivers who reported higher levels of conflict were less likely to spend time on platforms, often recruit passengers (and other drivers) to their preferred services, and "drop" platforms that are unable (or unwilling) to resolve their workplace disputes. This research demonstrates that, while gig work lacks the directive control found in a traditional workplace, the management of conflict and workplace disputes plays a central role in cultivating dense platform network effects. This result blends the theoretical work of platform economics with the organizational dispute resolution literature. In doing so, these findings extend the exit-voice-loyalty framework into the digital 1099 economy and suggests that the interplay between workers and organizations is a central strategic concern for platform managers and developers.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:04Z (GMT).

Herein, we revealed that knockout of a potent anti-inflammatory protein: murine regenerating islet-derived protein 3Œ≤ (REG3Œ≤), paradoxically enhanced insulin sensitivity, and completely blocked development of IR induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-mediated inflammation in mice. These knockout effects were reversed by exogenous REG3Œ≤ administration, and conferred by ablating two previously-unknown bindings of REG3Œ≤ to transmembrane proteins exostosin-like glycosyltransferase 3 (EXTL3) that suppressed expression of insulin receptor (INSR) and protein kinase B (AKT) and cytokine receptor C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) that inhibited phosphorylation of INSR and AKT. Prior conflicting effects of anti-inflammatory drugs on insulin sensitivity could now be explained by their different ability to alter tissue REG3Œ≤ protein. Suggested human homologue regenerating islet-derived protein 3Œ± (hREG3Œ±) exhibited similar functions to those of REG3Œ≤. Our work unveiled REG3Œ≤ as a potent negative determinant of insulin sensitivity and an essential mediator for inflammation to induce IR. These findings drastically revise current theory on the relationship of inflammation and IR, and offer an exciting new therapy target of IR and a safer, alternative prospect to treat inflammation in diabetes.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:05Z (GMT).

The development of the MarketMaker e-commerce website is used as a case study, and the underlying factors common to more general situations are explored. These include the design of technology solutions, stakeholder groups and their decision-making approaches, and the generation and use of data to drive decisions.  The design of technology solutions is becoming increasingly common as technologies develop and move deeper into organizations, creating more needs and opportunities. Solutions consequently become more complex, and they create larger and more diverse numbers of stakeholders and decision criteria. Decision-making in these situations can be facilitated with a formal data-driven methodology to analyze and visualize the options, minimize bias, and reveal insights.  The primary objective of this study was to generate and analyze data that could define stakeholder consensus regarding MarketMaker problems and opportunities, so that consensus-based decisions could be made about its continuing design and development. A comprehensive set of conceptual responses was gathered, and the results were analyzed and visualized. A series of maps and reports were created, producing a list of priority items the stakeholders could use to discuss and make decisions. Several conflicting perspectives were highlighted.  Among the recommendations discussed were to more effectively include external end users in the development of the MarketMaker website, as well as two potential variations on the traditional concept mapping process.

In Polistes paper wasps, mark-recapture studies and genetic analyses have shown that both cooperative and solitary nesting gynes can exhibit natal philopatry.  Male dispersal has not been studied in Polistes, therefore the potential effects of sex-biased dispersal on population structure are unknown.  In this study I used whole genome re-sequencing data from Polistes fuscatus wasps collected across the Eastern US to assess demographic history and population structure within a well-studied cooperatively breeding system.  In order to deduce the influence of sex-specific dispersal patterns on overall population structure, I analyzed population structure using nuclear as well as mitochondrial genomes.  While low pairwise Fst values indicated overall depressed levels of genetic differentiation, I found a consistent and significant pattern of spatial genetic clustering and isolation by distance in both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, supporting the hypothesis that limited female dispersal contributes towards population structure in P. fuscatus wasps.

The first two chapters share a common theme: the study of how the positive selection of employees -- identifying those who are more skilled and/or those who like their jobs more -- shapes the personnel practices of firms. The first chapter explores how firms' personnel policies -- retention and promotion -- shape employee careers with job moves both across and inside firms, whereas the second chapter focuses on the dynamic training investments of firms. The third chapter, instead, is an essay in "market design". In particular, I study the optimal design of a platform which hosts multiple auctions. The first chapter takes a step towards bridging the theory of external labor markets (ELM) and internal labor markets (ILM). A dynamic framework is constructed to understand how the personnel policy (e.g., retention and promotion) shapes the careers of employees with job moves both across and inside firms. The key insight of this chapter is that firms benefit from the positive selection of valuable employees in long-term employment relationships. In particular, an employee is valuable if she is highly skilled and/or likes her job. To begin with, the baseline model focuses on the retention policy in a labor market with firms competing for worker services. During working, each employee privately experiences a match quality, i.e., how much she likes a job, so she may change firms to find a better job. In equilibrium, firms are shown to adopt a dynamic screening mechanism -- wages are lowered in both the early careers and late careers of employees -- to positively select valuable employees, from whom a rent is captured.  We then embed a job ladder in the baseline model. This extended model allows firms to also enhance the value of employment by promoting more able employees. The equilibrium of this integrative model characterizes the personnel policy (e.g., retention and promotion) of firms, which is often treated as a black box in macro-labor models. Most importantly, our model captures three sets of stylized facts in a single setting: (i) ELM results (e.g., findings concerning job moves across firms); (ii) ILM results (e.g., findings concerning job moves inside firms); and (iii) "interaction" results concerning ELM and ILM (e.g., findings concerning the relationships between job moves across firms and job moves inside firms). The second chapter explores the idea that firms make training investments on a dynamic basis. That is, in a multi-period setting, firms could provide training to workers during any period (stage) of their careers. By assuming that information concerning worker abilities is delayed and that abilities and training investments are complements, two novel results emerge in equilibrium. First, firms could delay training to concentrate training investments towards "positively selected" workers (in terms of abilities). Second, the level of overall training investments could be higher with delayed training than that without delayed training. Our model provides a potential explanation for common personnel practices at professional services firms. That is: (i) training is often delayed at professional service firms, e.g., career-development programs and sponsored MBA education; (ii) professional service firms offer more overall training than other firms. Finally, the third chapter is an essay in "market design". On many online and offline platforms, e.g., eBay and livestock auction houses, buyers often face the choice among several auctions which sell almost identical or indistinguishable items. In this chapter, I study the optimal design of such platforms. In particular, I consider a centralized platform with multi-unit competing auctions, i.e., a platform hosting several single-unit auctions that could differ in their reserve prices. With a full characterization of buyers' choices among auctions, I show that the optimal platform entails a uniform reserve price which coincides with the monopoly reserve price of Myerson (1981) for a revenue-maximizing platform owner. This suggests that on a decentralized platform where sellers each offer an auction and compete for buyers by undercutting reserve prices, a platform owner, who earns a commission fee proportional to sellers' revenues (e.g., 10% on eBay), should impose a floor on reserve prices to mitigate the price competition among sellers.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:06Z (GMT).

RNI dithiolate ligands studied in the 1960‚Äôs contributed to our understanding of electronic structure and utilized the recently developed ligand field theory. Since then, RNI ligands have been discovered in naturally occurring sources such as cytchrome P-450, and have found myriad applications in synthetic transition metal chemistry and catalysis. RNI ligands can be leveraged to tune the electronic structure of transition metal complexes to confer nobility upon first row transition metals or promote desirable one electron processes.  	While RNI ligands of various forms have been studied for over 50 years, there is still much to be explored. Modern analytical techniques and computational methods have expanded the chemist‚Äôs ability to study these systems to gain a deeper understanding of the effects of electronic structure on reactivity. The purpose of this work is to expand the knowledge of RNI ligands and to understand how redox non-innocence manifests reactivity and affects the electronic structure of first row transition metal complexes. To achieve this goal, a detailed synthetic and reactivity study of the tetradentate diamide-diimine (dadi) ligand chelated to titanium, chromium, and iron was pursued. 	The study began initially with synthesis of the dadi ligand and the titanium, chromium, manganese, and iron complexes, which was performed by Dr. Wesley Morris in this laboratory. Following the early work of Dr. Morris, the reactivity of the chromium and iron dadi complexes was explored. This work found RNI was responsible for the processes observed in the system that ultimately lead to formal insertion of imidyls into the C-C bond of the ligand backbone. Along the same vein, the RNI of the dadi ligand was found to be critical for nitrene group transfer that generated adamantyl isocyanate, catalyzed by a titanium imido species.  In between these highlights of chemistry, various metal complexes were synthesized to probe the electronic structure, and to discover new and interesting chemistry. The diversity of reactions available to a single RNI ligand is exemplified in the later chapters of this work. A direct carbene transfer was discovered to be effected by the RNI dadi ligand, providing insight into the mechanism of metal catalyzed cyclopropanations. In the final expansion of this work, radical type reactions were discovered that diverge from the previously studied nitrene transfer, a 2-electron process."		2/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:07Z (GMT).

Major risks from environmental contamination due to drugs include death of organisms, habitat loss, mutation, and rise of antigen-resistant microbes. India has suffered enormous regional ecological damage from pharmaceutical contamination. Green chemistry approaches and environmentally-friendly pharmaceuticals exist, but they currently do not enjoy popular support from the pharmaceutical industry or consumers.   By conducting a public survey in Indore, India, this research attempts to understand whether consumers would support environmentally-friendly pharmaceuticals. The survey measures environmental concern, self-estimated knowledge, risk perception, and consumer intention. Statistical analyses indicate that environmental concern, self-estimated knowledge, and risk perception are each positively correlated with consumer intention. Results show that most people demonstrate environmentally-friendly consumer intention; and environmental concern was found to be its strongest indicator of consumer intention.

8955821a-7788-43ef-b6bc-4262462fb53a	123456789/41792			Meyer-Gutbrod, Joshua		Mettler, Suzanne Bridget		Michener, Jamila||Bateman, David Alexander	2018-10-22T18:45:07Z	2018-10-22T18:45:07Z		8/30/18		The increase in partisan polarization at the national level has corresponded to an increase in partisan resistance and a decline in the ability of the federal government to respond to public concerns with effective policy. While literature has shown that state politics has polarized in tandem with the national political parties, there are abundant examples of recent bi-partisan cooperation between national and state governments. This dissertation explores the conditions under which American federalism might offer a mechanism for mitigating polarization by producing these opportunities for bi-partisan policy implementation. I argue that conflict between national and state governments is a product of the electoral motivations of state politicians, as they are structured by two interrelated political institutions.  First, national political parties produce a national partisan agenda to which state politicians are held electorally accountable. Alongside their identification with a political party, state politicians must also contend with distinct local interests organized under American federalism and represented within state governments. I argue that, when the electoral incentives associated with American federalism and political parties encourage conflicting responses to federal policy, it can cross-pressure state officials resulting in negotiation between state politicians and partisan rivals at the national level.  By examining the history of federalism and historical trends in decentralization of federal funding, I show that polarization has encouraged national political parties to produce more coercive policy and to increasingly decentralize policy implementation to state partisan allies. This increases the potential for conflict with moderate state partisan allies due to variation in local constituent pressures. Examining a new database of state legislative response to federal preemption law, I find that there is significant bi-partisan implementation during the recent period of high polarization, with conflicts between state and federal agents more regularly arising from variation in local policy preferences. In examining the highly polarized Affordable Care Act, I find that unique local constituent preferences encouraged state politicians to deviate from the agenda of national partisan allies. This effect was magnified when the state majority party risked loss of control of state institutions due to a strong competitive partisan environment within the state. These results suggest that the potential for state politicians to engage in bi-partisan policy implementation with the national rivals is a direct product of national polarization and can provide an avenue for policy compromise and continued effective governance.

My thesis demonstrates that improving the accuracy of the machine learning algorithm in such systems is not only a question of the algorithm itself, but also a question of the user interface that directly affects the properties of feedback data the machine learner receives. To this end, this thesis introduces the concept of feedback-enhancing interface design as an alternate and complementary pathway to better machine learning performance. As I will show in this thesis, feedback-enhancing interfaces allow us to effectively shape the quantity as well as the quality of the obtained feedback data, all while maintaining usability and user experience.

Grapevines (Vitis spp.) resist cold through supercooling of water in their buds, and the level of cold hardiness is largely controlled by air temperature. Deacclimation during the spring is a determinant of timing of budbreak, and is one of the most critical periods for cold hardiness damage. The objective was to characterize the process of cold hardiness loss, or deacclimation, in grapevine buds. Several experiments were conducted to provide insights on deacclimation rates and effects on budbreak; location, distribution, propagation, and damage due to intracellular ice formation; and genes involved in the aforementioned processes. Cold hardiness of buds was determined using differential thermal analysis; genetic regulation was studied using RNA-Seq; and freezing imaging and microtomography was performed using synchrotron X-ray phase contrast imaging. Deacclimation rates (kdeacc) in several genotypes demonstrated a dependency on chill accumulation (dubbed deacclimation potential; Œ®deacc) that followed a logistic behavior. The curve describing the response of kdeacc to temperature followed an exponential at low (<12 ÔÇ∞C) and logarithmic behavior at high (ÔÇ≥12 ÔÇ∞C) temperatures. Budbreak phenotype appears tightly linked to kdeacc responses, and therefore Œ®deacc is a good quantitative parameter to determine dormancy transitions. Abscisic acid (ABA) synthesis and signaling appear to be upstream of cold hardiness loss, and ABA-induced aquaporins may be directly related to cold hardiness levels. CBF homologs were not differentially expressed during deacclimation, although other DREB homologs were. The roles of phospholipase D and stilbene synthase should be further explored in the deacclimation process. X-ray phase contrast imaging was not able to resolve ice within grapevine buds. However, movement of tissues due to changes in water density associated with a thermocouple for temperature measurement provided information to identify the center of the bud (primary shoot) as the first portion to freeze. Microtomography using x-ray phase contrast imaging demonstrated that an increase in bud volume is correlated to the loss of hardiness, but major tissue expansions occur after cold hardiness is lost.		2/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:14Z (GMT).

Sondermann, Holger||Oswald, Robert Edward	2018-10-22T18:45:15Z			8/30/18		Protein-Protein interactions are fundamental for varied biological processes. These interactions are governed by different forces between the proteins, which result in a wide range of interaction strengths. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is an atomistic technique commonly used to understand protein-protein interaction mechanisms, especially weak interactions (KD>¬µM). In this work, two different biological systems are studied by NMR. The first system that was studied is related to two proteins involved in cytoskeleton dynamics and cell migration, and the second is related to an enzyme-substrate interaction that controls a gene transcription regulation circuit.  In the first case, a novel mechanism for protein-protein interaction between the Ena/VASP Homology 1 (EVH1) domain of the actin polymerize regulator Vasodilator-Stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and the cytoskeleton protein Zyxin was determined. This interaction is important for cellular shape, cell motility and stress fiber repair. This study presented a model for a mechanism of action where phosphorylation can act as a stoichiometric switch and can explain the importance of the phosphorylation cycle in the localization of VASP by Zyxin.  The second protein-protein interaction focuses on the prolyl isomerase enzyme LRT2 (lateral rootless2) acting on the repressor protein OsIAA11. This interaction is critical for lateral root initiation in rice. The mechanism of action for this process is through the regulation of the cis-trans isomerization of the well conserved 104Trp-Pro105 peptide bond in OsIAA11. OsIAA11 plays a role in repressing gene expression in a manner dependent on the amount of the phytohormone Auxin. At high Auxin concentration, OsIAA11 is specifically degraded in the cis conformation of the 104W-P105 peptide bond. Thus, studies of LRT2 catalysis of OsIAA11 isomerization are essential to understand this fundamental biological process. In this dissertation, the microscopic equilibrium and rate constants of the LRT2 enzymatic cycle acting on OsIAA11 were determined by NMR lineshape analysis and validated by independent NMR exchange measurements. We found that LRT2 is optimally tuned for supplying maximum OsIAA11 in the cis isomer into a slower degradation pathway. Moreover, these studies predict that the catalyzed exchange rate is insensitive to concentrations of OsIAA11 at cellular conditions but scales lineally to the LRT2 concentration.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:15Z (GMT).

In contrast, the explicit use of disgust to promote positive outcomes is not as widely studied. Described as the emotion of unfettered rejection, disgust is considered helpful for promoting avoidance of harmful behaviors, such as smoking, but not for encouraging socially supportive behaviors, such as those that benefit the welfare of others. However, the health promotion literature has mainly considered disgust‚Äôs influence with select populations, and research on its use to promote other social issues is relatively dormant. This dissertation applies tenants from functional emotion and cognitive appraisal theories to three studies, extending research on disgust and health persuasion and initiating inquiry regarding disgust and charitable behavior. The first study explores how adolescents visually engage with disgust depictions in cigarette graphic warning labels and the relationship between attention, emotions, and risk beliefs. The second study also considers attentional processes, as well as message elaboration and behavioral intentions, in the context of a charitable appeal. Together, these studies suggest that disgust repels attention but effectively recruits other negative emotions that facilitate persuasive outcomes in both contexts. The final study tests the hypothesis that the prosocial persuasive context can shift processing patterns for disgust stimuli. Compared to disgust exposure independent of the prosocial context, the interaction of disgust exposure and a prosocial appeal reduced participants certainty appraisals and increased their empathetic responses. Results also show that feelings of disgust are not associated with behavior and suggest disgust appeals can promote helping behaviors similar to other emotional stimuli. Findings across the three studies have implications for how we conceptualize disgust and provide some considerations for the strategic use of disgust in persuasive communication.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:16Z (GMT).

The first chapter studies how bond ETFs affect the liquidity of the underlying corporate bonds. The second chapter complements the first chapter by analyzing how to properly measure liquidity in the bond market. The third chapter studies how ETFs affect the liquidity of the underlying stocks.  In chapter 1, "How do ETFs Affect the Liquidity of the Underlying Corporate Bonds?", I find that corporate bond ETFs improve the liquidity of the underlying bonds. I identify ETF arbitrage as an important channel for this positive impact. In the cross-section, the impact of ETFs is stronger on the less liquid bonds because these bonds are rarely traded by other types of investors.  In chapter 2, "Are Corporate Bond Liquidity Measures Reliable?", I analyze corporate bond liquidity measures by benchmarking them against the effective spreads calculated using Bloomberg quotes. I find that most liquidity measures tend to underestimate transaction costs, and many do not correlate well with the effective spreads. Among all the measures, Roll's measure is the best at estimating the magnitudes of trading costs, and regression-based methods are best at identifying the cross-sectional variation in bond liquidity. I then propose a procedure to compute effective spreads for corporate bonds.  In chapter 3, "How do ETFs Affect the Liquidity of the Underlying Stocks?", I find that ETF ownership is associated with higher transaction costs in the underlying stocks after 2010, but not from 2003 to 2010. The impact of ETF ownership is larger on large caps than small caps. Regarding the channels, I find that ETFs do not siphon trading away from the underlying market. On the other hand, ETF ownership causes liquidity to worsen during market stress for small stocks. My findings highlight that the impact of ETFs could be complicated, and differ for different periods and different stocks.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:15Z (GMT).

Hanrath, Tobias	2018-10-22T18:45:16Z			8/30/18		"The demand for semiconductor devices has grown over the past decades as the volume of data stored or processed have exponentially increased. To accommodate the needs, the capacity per volume was required to increase by order of magnitudes. Therefore, the scale down of the semiconductors has drawn semiconductor manufacturers‚Äô attention. Film deposition techniques, including Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD), have been investigated as result. ALD not only has layer-by-layer control of the film, but also has superior conformality compared to Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), another popular film deposition technique. In the effort to further scale down from the known ALD processes, area selective ALD has been researched in Engstrom Research Group (ERG).  	As the possible method for area selective ALD, the natural selectivity of newly discovered chemicals and adding the third species for site blocking, reversible chemisorption, and adduct formation are proposed.  Di-sec-butylaminosilane (DSBAS) showed the possibility for the area selectivity, as  DSBAS showed suppressed growth on Al2O3 substrate while showing normal growth on Cu substrate. 	Introducing the third species, denoted as co-adsorbate, also showed the possibility for certain combinations of the precursor and co-adsorbate: Study on Zirconium(IV) tert-butoxide (ZTB) as precursor and triethylamine (TEA) or pyridine as co-adsorbate, Trimethylaluminum (TMA) as precursor and TEA or 4-methylpyridine as co-adsorbate, and Tetrakis(ethylmethylamido) zirconium(IV)  (TEMAZ) as precursor and Phenyl Acetylene (PA) as co-adsorbate. All the combinations listed showed suppressed growth on one substrate but the normal growth on the other substrate.  Up to certain number of ALD cycle at certain conditions. 	For evaluating which co-adsorbate should be investigated with our ALD experiments, DiStasio group‚Äôs calculation of binding energy between the co-adsorbate and the two substrates, SiOx and Cu, was considered. The co-adsorbates with 10kcal/mol or more differences of binding energy with SiOx and Cu were selected and conducted in our experiments.  	The study includes the observation of film growth as condition modification which includes the modifications of the substrate temperature, partial pressure ratio of co-adsorbate and precursor, and residence time of precursor and co-adsorbate exposed to each other before reaching the substrates. The experiment results are analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and reported in original spectra and integrated intensity."		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:16Z (GMT).

Considering the long supply chain from the West Coast to the East Coast and the large volume being shipped, it is beneficial to create a regional supply of broccoli in the East Coast. New varieties of broccoli have been developed recently to address the quality issues of the existing Eastern varieties. The success of the new varieties could accelerate the development of the East Coast broccoli industry. Our study assessed the product attributes of the new varieties and elicited consumer willingness to pay for these products to estimate their market potential. A non-hypothetical experimental auction was used, combined with an information treatment on product origin. Multiple rounds of bidding were designed to identify the effect of taste on consumer willingness to pay. A market share simulation was conducted to draw implications for pricing strategies. The results suggest a strong market potential for one of the Eastern varieties. A potential price premium against the West Coast product could be justified when product origin information is provided and when consumers have the opportunity to taste the product. Market share simulations confirm the potential for the price premium and suggest an optimal price within a range of 25 cents from the West Coast product.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:17Z (GMT).

Typically, gyroscopes have two electromechanical resonators; a drive resonator which couples energy into the sense resonator through the Coriolis force. Challenges in SAW gyroscope instrumentation include the matching of drive and sense resonance frequencies, matching to 50 ohm impedance for electronics, and maximizing sensitivity while minimizing noise. In addition, the sensitivities to accelerations and other physical effects such as temperature swings need to be minimized. Piezoresistive graphene transducers, with high sensitivity, and ultralow mass density and negligible loading of SAW waves, and matching to 50 ohm by proper sizing, can provide a pathway to improving SAW gyroscope performance.  In this thesis, we study the electrode design and the alignment of graphene piezoresistive transducers in a two-port SAW resonator to maximize the sensitivity obtained by a biasing technique. By applying an external bias, current induced by SAW in graphene resistors can be canceled and large sensitivity at this bias point can be obtained. To characterize the sensitivity of graphene electrodes, we vary the widths, lengths and placement of the piezoresistor.  We calculate the effective gauge factor using the measured displacement as a function of RF amplitude. We have discovered that the piezoresistors of lambda/4 width, aligned between the node and antinode of the primary SAW will be the most sensitive configuration equivalent to an effective gauge factor of 1 x 10^8. This high gauge factor, enabled by fast digital processing, can lead to highly sensitive SAW gyroscopes and other electromechanical sensors.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:17Z (GMT).

This investigation used a quantitative questionnaire to describe perceptions among older adults at congregate meal sites. Responses were analyzed using SPSS. Poverty, education and race groups were compared using t-tests. The majority of older adults did not consume enough fluids. Knowledge of hydration, fruit and vegetable recommendations were positively associated with meeting hydration and vegetable recommendations. Low-income and Black older adults reported experience of less social support and greater desire for education in languages other than English. Community dwelling older adults may benefit from educational approaches that address hydration knowledge, and barriers and social support experienced by older adults with incomes below 100% the federal poverty level.

Roberson, Mark Stephen||Brenna, James Thomas||Thalacker-Mercer, Anna E.	2018-10-22T18:45:18Z			8/30/18		Phosphatidylcholines (PC) are the most abundant phospholipids in mammalian cells, where they serve well-characterized structural roles, maintaining membrane integrity, facilitating lipoprotein assembly and serving as a surfactant in the lung. Over the past decade, seminal papers have been published that describe novel roles for specific PC species derived from both the cytidine diphosphate-choline (CDP-choline) and phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) pathways of PC synthesis; these roles include both nuclear receptor agonism and generating critical physiological pools of the omega 3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).  In addition to these novel functions, complex interactions between PC and its substrate, choline, with growth and energetic status have emerged, following the observation that the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a major regulator of PC synthesis through the CDP-choline pathway. Presented in this dissertation are the tests of our primary hypotheses informed directly from these emerging areas of phosphatidylcholine biology.  Chapter 2 of this dissertation examines the impact of diet on the production of dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC), a phosphatidylcholine species enriched in lauric acid that was recently identified as a ligand for the nuclear receptor, liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1). DLPC binding to LRH-1 results in modulation of LRH-1-dependent hepatic gene expression and improvements in glucose and lipid handling. While DLPC has been convincingly shown to bind and activate LRH-1 when provided exogenously to cultured cells and mice, endogenous production of DLPC has not been observed, questioning its significance in the regulation of mammalian physiology. We hypothesized that the absence of DLPC in mammalian tissues results from substrate insufficiency (i.e. low lauric acid supply) and that provision of lauric acid, either in the culture media or the mammalian diet, will result in endogenous DLPC production, and be associated with functional LRH-1 activation. Cell culture models, animal feeding experiments, and a single-blind, randomized, controlled crossover acute feeding study in human participants were used to test this hypothesis. As hypothesized, provision of lauric acid in the cell culture media, animal diet, and human diet resulted in the acute and chronic production of DLPC. In cultured cells, this was associated with upregulation of LRH-1 dependent transcripts, an effect that was blunted by co-treatment with a LRH-1 antagonist. In animals, feeding of high fat diets containing lauric acid, utilizing purified lauric acid or coconut oil-based diets, resulted in substantial improvements in glucose handling as indicated by an oral glucose tolerance test.  Chapter 3 of this dissertation examines the association of dietary choline intake and reproductive stage with plasma lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-DHA among women participants of a 10 week controlled feeding study. LPC-DHA has been recently highlighted as a physiological pool of DHA for maintaining the supply of this critical polyunsaturated fatty acid to extrahepatic organs during growth and development. We hypothesized that reproductive life-stage, dietary choline intake (22% provided as deuterium-labeled choline) and genetic variants in one-carbon metabolism would impact plasma unlabeled and labeled LPC-DHA in response to controlled feeding. To address these hypotheses, we measured unlabeled and deuterium-labeled plasma LPC-DHA in samples from a previously conducted controlled feeding study performed in non-pregnant, pregnant, and lactating women randomized to either 480 or 930mg of choline per day. Consistent with our hypotheses, we observed a significant reduction in unlabeled plasma LPC-DHA in pregnant and lactating women relative to non-pregnant women at week 10; only non-pregnant women exhibited significant increases in LPC-DHA from baseline to week 10 while consuming the study diets. Choline intake and one-carbon metabolism variants were not associated with unlabeled plasma LPC-DHA. However, both choline intake and reproductive life-stage altered the enrichment of PEMT- and CDP-choline-derived LPCs. In Chapter 4 of this dissertation, we explore roles for choline and phospholipid metabolism in the context of a novel animal model of adolescent severe acute malnutrition (aSAM). This complex disorder is characterized by negative energy balance, impaired growth, and multiple micronutrient deficiencies; severe forms of aSAM, namely kwashiorkor, are further complicated by an idiopathic fatty liver. The sensitivity of this fatty liver to dietary choline remains unknown. To characterize the potential for choline supplementation to serve as a metabolic therapy in aSAM, we developed a maize vegetable diet (MVD), comprised of foods typically consumed by children who will go on to develop kwashiorkor. The MVD was fed to weanling mice with or without choline supplementation, and compared to typical chow diets, to determine impacts on growth, body composition, and potential to alleviate the hallmark characteristic of kwashiorkor, fatty liver. We further explored the metabolic fate of dietary choline, hypothesizing that choline would be oxidized to betaine to support PC synthesis through the PEMT pathway in this context of lower mTORC1 activity and reduced CDP-choline pathway activity. Mice consuming our novel maize vegetable diet exhibited impaired growth relative to chow fed mice, and developed hepatic steatosis, consistent with human kwashiorkor. The addition of choline to the maize vegetable diet resulted in amelioration of the hepatic steatosis, and a greater hepatic concentration of betaine; choline partitioning to betaine is consistent with a role for the PEMT pathway in supporting PC synthesis in the context of malnutrition.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:18Z (GMT).

The resulting insight increases our understanding of biological processes and can aid in structure-based drug design. However, SAXS experiments require tens of microliters of sample at mg/mL concentrations, making the technique unsuitable for molecules that cannot be produced in large quantity. This dissertation introduces three new techniques for sample efficient SAXS experiments.  The first details the fabrication and use of fixed path length sample cells for cryoSAXS experiments, as well as their challenges. The cells have rigid walls with low scatter and high X-ray transmission, and allow SAXS measurements from less than two microliters of sample. Although fractures in the vitrified samples produce irreproducible scatter at the lowest angles, the technique is robust and applicable to molecules with maximum dimension less than ~160 √Ö.  The second method implements a coaxial, continuous flow diffusive mixer for low sample volume time-resolved SAXS on the 10 ms - 3 s timescale. The mixer‚Äôs geometry allows the use of a larger, higher flux beam than is compatible with most continuous flow SAXS mixers, shortening the acquisition time and reducing sample consumption. A custom beamline setup reduces background scatter to further improve data quality. Each measurement uses less sample than a conventional static SAXS experiment. A study of RNA folding initiated by Mg2+ is presented as an example of the utility of this technique. The final method employs a chaotic advection mixer for time-resolved SAXS measurements on slowly diffusing systems. This device incorporates a miniaturized static mixer to efficiently mix two liquids in the laminar flow regime. An improved beamline setup delivers a higher flux beam than can be used with the diffusive mixer, minimizing acquisition time and sample consumption. This mixer uses an order of magnitude less sample than turbulent flow SAXS mixers, and about twice the sample needed for a conventional static SAXS measurement. Time-resolved SAXS measurements of the binding of trypsin and aprotinin, a well-studied protein pair, are presented as a proof of principle.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:18Z (GMT).

We evaluated the antimicrobial effect of LO alone and with the components of the LPS: NaSCN and lactoperoxidase. An increase in LO caused higher reductions of Pseudomonas fragi in pasteurized milk. A total bacterial growth curve in raw milk showed a longer lag phase and lower counts when the LPS was activated by LO compared to the control. The antimicrobial effect of LO against foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms was evaluated through an overlay inhibition assay. LO was applied in different media to evaluate the effect of lactose and SCN-. All the indicators were inhibited by LO in presence of lactose. However, NaSCN had no effect on the inhibition. The antimicrobial effect was attributed to H2O2 produced from the oxidation of lactose.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:18Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Although these populations are affected by events throughout the year, basic knowledge of nonbreeding habitat selection, habitat quality, and migratory connectivity is often lacking. Habitat conservation is further challenged by behaviors, such as intraspecific competition and niche specialization, that can lead males and females to occupy different nonbreeding regions and habitats. This dissertation aimed to fill knowledge gaps regarding habitat selection, quality, and connectivity, with a special focus on cases where males and females segregate spatially. Specifically, we examined (1) the prevalence of sexual segregation among migratory landbirds and the degree to which conservation plans considered the behavior; (2) patterns, drivers, and conservation implications of sexual segregation in declining population of the Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera); and (3) migratory connectivity and migration strategies for the Golden-winged Warbler and the closely related Blue-winged Warbler (Vermivora cyanoptera).  Our review of the published literature and conservation plans for 66 North American migratory landbirds of concern revealed that sexual segregation is a relatively common phenomenon yet is systematically overlooked in conservation plans. Working across Central America and New York between 2014 and 2017, we surveyed male and female Golden-winged Warblers, modeled fall arrival and overwintering occupancy, assessed body condition, and deployed geolocators on select males. Results suggest that sexual segregation is driven primarily by male exclusion of females from high quality habitat in nonbreeding sites, which results in mid- to high-elevation evergreen broadleaf forests being male-biased and lower elevation habitat with less structural diversity being female-biased. The failure to explicitly consider sexual segregation in conservation plans resulted in focal areas that over-represented male-dominated areas, despite greater habitat loss in female-dominated areas. In addition, our data from geolocators showed that Golden-winged Warblers employed a migration strategy that minimized spring migration time and used a previous undescribed stopover region in Guatemala and Mexico ‚Äì with connectivity and timing being distinct from the Blue-winged Warbler.  Overall, our research elucidates the causes and consequences of sexual segregation, highlights the importance of considering nonbreeding ecology in conservation plans, and provides new information to guide Golden-winged Warbler conservation.

I provide a brief description of each below: 1. In ¬ß76 of the third Critique, Kant characterizes an intuitive intellect as a mind that represents the world only as it is. Taken together with his commitment to a divine intuitive intellect, this gives rise to a problem: If God does not represent other ways the world could be, it would seem to follow that there is no other way the world could be, which would be an unwelcome implication for Kant given his commitment to a conception of human freedom that presupposes that our moral characters could be other than they are. The first essay of this dissertation explores the philosophical resources Kant has to reconcile these commitments.  2. According to a received view, Kant maintains that only God could possess an intuitive intellect, i.e., a mind with an ‚Äòintellectual intuition‚Äô or, equivalently, an ‚Äòintuitive understanding‚Äô of objects. Such a view finds support in the first Critique, for instance, where Kant writes, "intellectual intuition [‚Ä¶] seems to pertain only to the original being" and in lecture transcripts where we read, "[o]nly the understanding of God is called intuition." However, such a view is also brought into question by neglected texts suggesting that it involves a considerable oversimplification of his position. The second essay of this dissertation examines these texts in an effort to illuminate Kant‚Äôs conceptions of the intuitive and human intellects. 3. Scribbled in the margins of Kant‚Äôs copy of Baumgarten‚Äôs Metaphysica, we read: "That is the divinity of our soul, that it is capable of ideas." This final essay pursues this description of our ideas as "the divinity of our soul" with the aim of correcting a popular but misleading narrative that the critical Kant flatly rejects a theocentric model on which human cognition is measured against the norm of the divine intuitive intellect. Along the way, it also suggests a significant and ultimately illuminating Platonic influence on Kant‚Äôs notion of an intuitive intellect and on the critical philosophy more broadly.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:20Z (GMT).

Feigenson, Gerald W.||Anderson, Catherine Lindsay	2018-10-22T18:45:19Z			8/30/18		Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) Spectroscopy is a powerful method to study structure and dynamics of biomolecules. It detects magnetic resonance signals from the spin labels (or paramagnetic tags) attached at specific locations of a biological sample such as proteins, DNA, RNA, and lipids, among others. Despite many improvements in ESR instrument sensitivity, experimental signals lack sufficient strength that is needed to study complex biomolecules. We introduce signal processing methods as an alternate approach to remove noise present in the experimental ESR signals. We developed new methods based on wavelet transforms that are effectively able to retrieve signals, including weak signals. The methods are developed for one-dimensional continuous wave electron spin resonance (cw-ESR) signals and pulsed dipolar signals. The denoising methods achieve more than two orders-of-magnitude improvement in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) as well as can be used to reduce signal acquisition time by similar orders. In cw-ESR, the experimental signals obtained from the spectrometer are directly analyzed. Hence, there is no need for further data processing. In pulsed dipolar spectroscopy, the acquired signal needs to be processed to obtain desired information, i.e. distance distribution between a pair of spin labels. In addition to wavelet denoising, we developed a singular value decomposition (SVD) method to obtain well-resolved accurate distance distributions from the dipolar signals. The SVD method overcomes the limitations of standard Tikhonov regularization method that yields are compromise between a good resolution and a stable solution, as well as the limitation of model fitting methods that require a priori information. Further, we conducted the uncertainty analysis of the SVD solution. This research is first step towards utilizing the power of data processing methods to improve signal analysis in ESR spectroscopy.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:19Z (GMT).

This coalescence is perhaps not entirely coincidental. Many of the bureaucratic forms that permeate contemporary scientific practice are themselves concerned with the problem of the sciences‚Äô relationship to and impact upon the world beyond it. In this dissertation, I use ethnography of a China-based agri-environmental research organization, the Institute for Farms and Forests (IFF), as the basis for analyzing the bureaucratization of science and the frustrated desires of scientists to make a positive difference to the world. I demonstrate how emerging bureaucratic planning and audit regimes impose temporal structures that are incongruous with scientists‚Äô conceptualizations of scientific practice. As, for example, in the incongruity between a planning and audit technology called ‚Äòtheory of change‚Äô that orientates scientists towards a utopian vision of the future that they want to bring into being and an IFF scientist‚Äôs vague hope that her research might be put to use in ways that she cannot anticipate. I show, furthermore, that while the intention of theory of change is to help scientists generate momentum towards impact, scientists more often experience imperatives to employ technologies like theory of change as an unwelcome interruption to scientific practice. Through ethnography of the diverse forms of momentum and interruption that animate scientific and bureaucratic practice, I develop an analytic framework for responding to the dual challenges of bureaucratization and of making science make a difference. I argue that rather than responding to the imposition of audit by battling for scientific autonomy, we should expend our energies seeking new opportunities for science to interrupt and for science to be interrupted.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:20Z (GMT).

Still unknown is how in-stream characteristics and temporal variabilities may affect observed riverine microplastic concentrations. In this thesis I investigate dams‚Äô influence on the spatial heterogeneity of microplastics, the affect that time of sampling (time of day and seasonal flow condition) has on the microplastic concentration measured, and whether upstream wastewater management strategies affect the patterns observed. I find that that dams act as a sink for microplastics, capturing significantly higher concentrations of microplastics in the reservoir behind them than is found in areas of settling upstream or downstream of them.  My analysis also demonstrates that flow condition is a significant predictor of microplastic concentration at a given location while other measured parameters, including upstream wastewater management strategies, are not.  By indicating that flow condition is an important control on measured concentration, this research improves future studies‚Äô ability to interpret and properly apply the findings of existing riverine microplastic surveys. Additionally, by improving our understanding of how hydrologic conditions and the presence of in-stream barriers affect the transport of microplastics in rivers, this research helps to reduce uncertainty in models that attempt to quantify the magnitude of global microplastic pollution and the rate at which it grows.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:21Z (GMT).

This dissertation presents an automated framework for quantitative image biomarker measurement and evaluation from the low-dose chest CT (LDCT) scans that are acquired during the annual lung cancer screening. Four categories of quantitative image biomarkers are investigated, including breast density and gynecomastia quantification, bone mineral density (BMD), airway dimensions and pulmonary nodule classification. An anatomy directed approach is applied to the analysis of the breast region and to the biomarker measurements. The fully automated breast density assessment and gynecomastia measurements have been demonstrated to be consistent with the reading of radiologists. Fully automated BMD assessment is achieved by building upon the model-based segmentation and anatomical labeling of individual vertebral body. Statistically significant strong correlation with the gold standard reference can be obtained at all vertebral levels. A fully automated knowledge-based approach is applied to the segmentation and anatomical labeling of each airway bronchus, which enables the measurements of precise and reproducible airway dimensions. For the classification of pulmonary nodule malignancy, a 3D CNN is trained from scratch and demonstrates various advantages over both the traditional machine learning approaches using hand-crafted 3D image features and the 2D CNN models. Classifier ensembles of the combinations of the 3D CNN and traditional machine learning models achieve the best performance by taking advantage of the complementary characteristics of the traditional models and the CNN models.         In conclusion, with the recent large-scale implementation of annual lung cancer screening in the US using LDCT, great potential emerges for the concurrent extraction of quantitative image biomarkers from different regions in the chest, which are covered in LDCT. This dissertation has demonstrated the feasibility of fully automated measurement and evaluation of a rich set of quantitative image biomarkers, and the opportunity to significantly enhance the impact of LDCT by offering a comprehensive health assessment to each screening participant with no additional imaging or radiation exposure."

These channels have been classified as large ‚Äòpore forming‚Äô proteins which, when activated, create a passageway through the cell membrane through which ions and molecules transit.  Current literature suggests that the actual pannexin channel is formed from a hexameric arrangement of individual monomeric pannexin subunits, resulting in a central permeation pathway for conducting ions.  Opening of pannexin channels can be accomplished through several mechanisms.  During apoptosis, for example, cleavage of the pannexin C-terminal domain results in a constitutively open channel through which ATP is released.  However, curiously, pannexins have also been known to be activated by a variety of other stimuli such as cellular depolarization, exposure to signaling ions like Ca2+ and K+, and interacting with various other membrane receptors like members of the ATP-sensing P2X and P2Y family.  How can pannexin channels sense and respond to such a diverse array of stimuli, and what is the fundamental ‚Äògating process‚Äô that defines channel opening? Here, we use electrophysiology to study the activation of pannexin-1 (Panx1).  We used a protein chimera approach to identify that the first extracellular domain of Panx1 is critical for inhibitor action.  Mutagenesis of this region identified that bulky hydrophobic amino acids in this region confer sensitivity of the channel to various drug compounds.  We also identified that the very N-terminus of Panx1 is important for voltage sensing, and that subtle modifications of the N-terminus results in channels with altered channel gating when exposed to voltage stimulation.  Finally, we made attempts to solve the structure of a Panx1 channel.  Iterative rounds of optimization yielded crystals that diffract x-rays just beyond 5 √Ö.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:22Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Crane, Brian||Schroeder, Frank	2018-10-22T18:45:22Z			8/30/18		This thesis investigates the role of covalent heme modifications in the oxidation of NH2OH. The first chapter examines the production of N2O under anaerobic conditions via the oxidation of NH2OH by cyt P460 N. europaea. Under aerobic conditions, cyt P460 N. europaea only produced sub stochiometric amounts of NO2‚àí. This is in direct contrast to previous literature, which stated the oxidation of NH2OH by cyt P460 resulted in the production of NO2‚àí. This chapter also discusses how the discovery that cyt P460 does not oxidize NH2OH to NO2‚àí prompted further examination on the product of NH2OH oxidation by HAO.        The next chapter begins with identification of the 6-coordinate (6c) {FeNO}7 species, a key intermediate in the NH2OH oxidation pathway of cyt P460.33 This key intermediate also led to further discussion on the role of the cross-link in catalysis. The mechanism for N2O production by cyt P460 necessitates a 6c {FeNO}7 and a {FeNO}6 as intermediates. The 5-coordinate (5c) {FeNO}7 species was shown to be catalytically incompetent.29 Treatment of FeII cyt P460 with a NO donor forms the 6c {FeNO}7 species that will slowly decay to the 5c {FeNO}7 species. However, removal of the cross-link now generates a fast 6c to 5c conversion that is now NO dependent. The dependence on NO for His dissociation after the formation of the {FeNO}7 species is similar to other heme NO signaling proteins. Therefore, the presence of the cross-link is necessary in order to avoid the 5c {FeNO}7 dead end species.         However, the cross-link deficient variant does not exhibit NH2OH oxidase activity. Therefore, the presence of the cross-link must be important in activating the heme towards NH2OH oxidation, this question is addressed in the next two chapters of the thesis. Chapter 4 first analyzes whether the difference in reactivity comes from the degree of ruffling in the P460 center. The degree of heme ruffling has been proposed to direct the reactivity of the P460 cofactor.35 The degree of ruffling has been shown to modulate reduction potential, where a more ruffled heme exhibits a lower more negative reduction potential.35 Ruffling has also been proposed to increase the stability of the {FeNO}6.36 Chapter 4 therefore addresses if the cross-link deficient variants lose NH2OH oxidase activity due to the formation of a more planar heme site.  Chapter 5 further examines the differences in reactivity of the cross-link deficient variant compared to wild-type (WT) cyt P460. This analysis suggests that the role of the cross-link may be to generate a radically different heme center that is important in directing its ability to carry out direct substrate bound oxidation.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:22Z (GMT).

They are capable of mobilizing charges over vast distances through the use of relay residues, which behave as intermediary sites for electron localization and hopping. The electron transfer rate is primarily determined by driving force, reorganization energies, and electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor species, as modeled by the Marcus equation. However, these parameters are not readily obtained by in vitro experiments and the reaction may be further complicated by proton transfer events. Thus, systems amenable to facile manipulation of these parameters are highly advantageous for in vitro studies. Tyrosine and tryptophan are among the most prevalent relay residues in electron transfer systems, but despite their similarities, one can not easily replace the functionality of the other. In our first protein model system, yeast cytochrome c peroxidase:cytochrome c, we substituted the conserved tryptophan electron hopping site with a tyrosine residue, allowing us to gain insight into the behavior of tyrosyl radicals in electron transfer and the effect of its local environment on activity. Our findings evince that inclusion of a basic side chain that coordinates to the phenolic proton is essential for augmenting electron transfer rates through the hopping site. Other relay amino acids also play significant roles in proteins, including methionine and cysteine residues. In our second protein model, we use a flavoprotein photosensor (VIVID) variant that is devoid of an active-site cysteine residue essential for generating the canonical light-oxygen-voltage domain flavin signaling state. We demonstrated that this protein variant is surprisingly capable of in vivo signaling and light-dependent conformational changes. From spectroscopic investigations, we identified the elusive electron donors responsible for the formation of this signaling state and show the importance of methionine residues in transferring electrons. Herein, I have disseminated our findings on these two projects, furthering our understanding of the intricacies of protein electron transfer and the necessary properties of relay residues for facilitating electron transfer reactions. Firstly, in Chapter 2 and Appendix A, I discuss our findings on intermolecular electron transfer through a tyrosyl hopping site in the cytochrome c peroxidase complex and recovery of activity through manipulation of the tyrosyl environment. Following this, I relate investigations of a photoactive model system comprised of internal electron donors. In Chapter 3, I evaluate the ability of the active-cysteine-less VIVID variant to induce a biologically relevant signaling response in blue light, and in Chapter 4, I describe continued investigations on the intrinsic electron transfer mechanism involved in photoactivation, with some burgeoning discoveries on an analogous photoactive system presented in Appendix B.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:23Z (GMT).

Does skin color affect the educational and labor market outcomes of different racial groups? Is the increased educational resemblance of spouses related to the takeoff in income inequality among Black and White households? Three separate articles, each using unique data and methods, provide new approaches to these questions. The first article compares sibling correlations in income -a measure of social immobility- across Black and White populations and explains the higher mobility rates displayed by Blacks. Using Bayesian models for dispersion, I find that Blacks display lower sibling correlation than Whites due the larger income heterogeneity among children of the same family. This pattern is partially explained by the poorer socioeconomic standing of Blacks parents, but part of the Black-White remains unexplained. The second article studies the effects of skin color on the educational attainment and earnings of individuals of different racial groups. Using regression and sibling fixed-effects models, I find that, after accounting for the higher socioeconomic status of lighter skinned families, skin color has no effect on educational attainment, but it has a positive effect on the income of Black men and women. Additionally, this study finds that Blacks are the group that displays the largest variability in skin color while Whites' skin tone is almost invariant. Finally, the third article uses micro-simulations to understand the impact of trends and patterns of educational assortative mating on the increase of income inequality for Black and White families. The results provide an exhaustive confirmation of the minor or null effect of the educational assortative mating on income inequality, ruling out some possible explanations for this finding. Results suggest that such null effect is not due to offsetting trends for Blacks and Whites; to countervailing effects of educational expansion and changing assortative behavior; to insufficiently strong changes in assortative mating and selection into marriage; or to the use of methods that are not able to detect complex patterns. Taken together, the three articles address key discussions in the social stratification literature, informed by principled and innovative empirical strategies.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:23Z (GMT).

These affine growth diagrams are in bijection with the $c_{\vec\lambda}$ many components of the polygon space Poly($\vec\lambda$) for $\vec\lambda$ a sequence of minuscule weights and $c_{\vec\lambda}$ the Littlewood--Richardson coefficient. Unlike Fomin growth diagrams, they are infinite periodic on a staircase shape, and each vertex is labeled by a dominant weight of $GL_m$. Letting $m$ go to infinity, a dominant weight can be viewed as a pair of partitions, and we recover the RSK correspondence and Fomin growth diagrams within affine growth diagrams. The main combinatorial tool used in the proofs is the $n$-hive of Knutson--Tao--Woodward. The local growth rule satisfied by the diagrams previously appeared in van Leeuwen's work on Littelmann paths, so our results can be viewed as a geometric interpretation of this combinatorial rule. Similar diagrams appeared in the work of Speyer on osculating flags.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:24Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

I advance two arguments: (1) parallel to neoliberalism‚Äôs consolidation, the university and an emerging theory canon become necessary prostheses for the literary institution‚Äôs reproduction and, (2) study, when understood as a form of unwaged, reproductive labor, transforms educational institutions into potential sites for anti-work politics. Reproductions explores the implications of the increasing dependence of literary production on educational institutions and their social reproductive functions. Part One joins the growing consensus that struggles against capital have moved from the terrain of waged, productive work to that of unwaged, reproductive labor. I assemble an archive that exposes a representational crisis in the ranks of Chile‚Äôs 2011 student movement. Beneath the opposition of peaceful, student protestors to violent, masked rioters, I suggest a point of solidarity in their shared marginalization from wage-labor. This helps me reconceive study as reproductive labor against the neoliberal model of study as human capital investment. Turning from university politics to its theorization, I contend that philosopher Willy Thayer‚Äôs genealogy of Chile‚Äôs neoliberal university defends academic labor at the cost of reifying the myth of university autonomy and obscuring the work of study. My argument culminates in what I call study-without-end, at once an alternative pedagogy and anti-work politics, developed in dialog with the research militancy of Colectivo Situaciones, a theory collective active in the wake of Argentina‚Äôs 2001 economic crisis. As practiced by the collective and their interlocutors in Argentina‚Äôs unemployed workers‚Äô movements, study-without-end heralds the possibility of instituting ephemeral moments of political-economic autonomy.  Part Two shifts from social reproduction through educational institutions to the cultural reproduction of the literary institution. I contend that the consecration of theoretical fictions penned by two generations of contemporary Chilean and Argentinean writers is symptomatic of a convergence among literary, critical, and educational institutions since the 1980s. In Ricardo Piglia‚Äôs understudied late works, I see a critique that intervenes in the reproduction of the literary institution. Piglia blurs the boundaries between criticism and fiction in order to prefigure his works‚Äô reception and contribute to their canonization. Among the youngest generation of novelists, Pola Oloixarac adopts similar novelistic strategies. By addressing her work to a university-educated audience, she ingratiates herself with the literary institution‚Äôs gatekeepers. I return to the earlier generation to show how Diamela Eltit‚Äôs writing insists on the banal objecthood of literature. Unlike her contemporary Piglia, Eltit threatens the literary institution‚Äôs reproduction by voicing a non-reproductive desire.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:25Z (GMT).

Two main classes of polymeric materials were explored, investigated, and evaluated as promising electrodes for EES applications: thin-film and bulk polymers. In the first half of this dissertation, I studied, in detail, the electrosynthesis of a library of polypyrrole anchored redox-active pendant decorated thin-film polymers. The polymer architecture was designed to boost electronic conductivity of the polymer by installing a conducting polymer as backbone, and energy density was maximized by employing highly reversible redox-active moieties including 1,4-dimethoxybenzene (DMB), N,N,N‚Äô,N‚Äô-tetramethylphenylenediaine (TMPD). By having two stable redox couples at high potentials, PPy-5C-TMPD was shown to have the most promising electrochemical properties, amongst the molecules studied. However, this thin-film polymer exhibited severe charge trapping behavior, in which half of the capacity was missing during reduction of the polymer, as if anions (or charges) were "trapped" inside the polymer film. This so-called "charge trapping" phenomenon was studied in detail to unravel its origin, and results indicated that the phenomenon appears to be specific to TMPD as a redox-active pendant. Substitution of the redox-active pendant to equally high-energy 5,5‚Äô-bis(methylthio)-2,2‚Äô- bithiophene (BMTbT) resulted in no signs of charge trapping. I then explored bulk polymer materials, by coupling redox-active moieties in alternating fashion by Buchwald-Hartwig coupling to form main-chain redox-active polymers. By coupling phenothiazine with N,N‚Äô-dimethylphenylenediamine (PT- DMPD), the resulting polymers showed three main redox couples. EQCM and other mechanistic studies suggested that the redox activities of PT-DMPD involved the exchange of three electrons. As battery material, two of the redox processes could be accessed. Initial cycling performance of PT-DMPD showed capacity fade likely due to polymer dissolution. Cross-linking of PT units by a butyl alkyl linker enabled different degrees of cross-linked polymers to be prepared. Upon optimization, 10%CL PT- DMPD showed the best performance, reaching close to 100 % of its theoretical capacity. An impressive rate performance was also achieved with this material, reaching 120 C with 82 % capacity retention, an unprecedented rate performance among organic materials. These studies on organic electrode materials have demonstrated promising electrochemical properties of these materials for EES applications, and device level testing suggested potentials for practical application. Using these results as a part of motivation, future researchers should focus on better design while maintaining chemical stability of the polymers, and perhaps aided by our studies, find better performing organic materials for EES application.		2/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:26Z (GMT).

Use-based privacy is shown to benefit from a reactive policy language---one that specifies not only a current set of restrictions but also describes how those restrictions change. An instantiation of such a reactive language, the Avenance language, is defined; its expressiveness is demonstrated with real-world policies. The dissertation also explores the feasibility of a technical means for enforcing compliance. Systems are described for facilitating policy compliance by benign principals and architectures for enforcing policy compliance in the presence of adversarial principals. A policy provider that associates use-based privacy policies with sensitive values as policy tags also is described. The described work collectively constitutes strong evidence for the feasibility of use-based privacy.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:26Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In particular, we focus on the disparity in timescales over which microscopic forces - hydrodynamic, Brownian and other interparticle forces - act and drive transient rheology, via the theoretical framework of active microrheology. In active microrheology, a probe particle is driven and its motion is tracked in order to infer the physical properties of the surrounding medium. As the probe moves through the suspension, it distorts the particle arrangement (or the microstructure) around it. The microstructure around the probe evolves in time and reaches a steady state at long times. The steady-state structure and its corresponding rheological behaviors are well understood: the relative importance of microscopic forces evolves with the strength of the external flow, which leads to sustained microstructural asymmetry that in turn gives rise to familiar non-Newtonian behaviors like flow-thinning and flow-thickening. However, the transition from equilibrium to steady flow is sometimes marked by overshoots or oscillations in stress or viscosity that suggest a temporally evolving competition between the rate processes that dissipate and store flow energy. Likewise, the evolution of particle microstructure from equilibrium structure to its steady-state asymmetric structure takes place over observable timescales, suggesting a temporally evolving balance between colloidal-scale forces. Similarly, if the external flow is suddenly removed, the particle gradients in the steady-state structure relax over a finite time.  In this dissertation, we study the evolution of structure in time, and the corresponding transient rheology during sudden microrheological flow startup and cessation. During flow startup, the motion of the probe drives its surrounding particles out of equilibrium. Brownian motion of the particles gives rise to an entropic restoring force that acts to restore the equilibrium configuration. The ratio of the external force to the restoring entropic force defines a P√©clet number,  Pe = Fext/(2kT/ath), where Fext is the magnitude of the external force, ath is the thermodynamic radius of the particles, and kT is the thermal energy of the bath. An excluded annulus shell is utilized to model arbitrary repulsion range between particles, or arbitrary strengths of hydrodynamic interactions between particles. The relative strengths of the entropic and hydrodynamic forces are set by the repulsion range, Œ∫ = (ath ‚àí a)/a (where a is the hydrodynamic radius of the particles), between a pair of particles in a suspension of hydrodynamically interacting repulsive hard spheres. We formulate and solve a transient Smoluchowski equation that governs the spatiotemporal evolution of the particle microstructure around a probe. The governing equations are solved analytically in the asymptotic limit of weak probe forcing, Pe, where microstructural distortions are indistinguishable from equilibrium Brownian fluctuations. The equations are also solved analytically for arbitrary Pe in the dual limits of weak and strong hydrodynamic interactions to examine the early-time structural evolution during flow startup. For arbitrary strengths of Pe and Œ∫, numerical methods were utilized to obtain the transient structural evolution upon flow startup and cessation. The time-dependent structure was then connected to the transient viscosity of the suspension utilizing statistical mechanics.  We find that hydrodynamic forces grow slowly in time relative to conservative entropic forces during flow startup: at early times, hydrodynamic and entropic Brownian viscosities scale quadratically and linearly, respectively, and therefore the Brownian viscosity dominates the total viscous drag at early times. Since the Brownian contribution to the viscosity decreases monotonically with increasing flow strength, the total viscosity flow-thins at early times after flow startup, a trend that ultimately reverses at long times to give the expected flow- thickening at steady state. This behavior owes its origin to the dominance of Brownian diffusion in setting short-time particle dynamics, regardless of Pe, which hinders maturation of the boundary layer. Later, when the relatively slowly growing advective relative motion dominates, particles remain coupled together long enough to produce the long-duration interactions associated with flow-thickening behavior. This lengthening of the duration of pair encounters as hydrodynamic coupling grows stronger delays the attainment of steady-state viscosity. An overshoot in the Brownian contribution to the viscosity signals the final formation of the boundary layer in the downstream region of the probe, giving way to "time-thinning", a post-overshoot decay of viscosity to its steady-state value, where advection ultimately outpaces the ability of Brownian motion to viscously dissipate flow energy. This apparent "yield" behavior is simply a transition from more viscous to less viscous flow set by relative relaxation timescales of the structure, revealing that overshoots can be explained at a pair level as a disparity between entropic and advective transport rates. Time-dependent fixed-Pe hydro-thinning and hydro-thickening behaviors are discussed.  Upon flow cessation, the non-Newtonian rheology arising directly from hydrodynamic forces dissipates instantaneously, as expected, while the entropic contributions decay over an observable timescale. This disparity in timescales can be utilized in a flow cessation experiment to decouple the individual microscopic contributions to steady-state rheology. We find that while increasing the pre-cessation flow strength enhances both the structural and rheological relaxation rates, hydrodynamic interactions slow down both relaxation rates by hindering relative particle motion. The dissipation of stored entropic energy in the steady-state deformed structure is explored, and we find that the distorted structure gives rise to an entropic force that drives the probe motion even after the external force on the probe is removed. We find that the probe back travels after flow cessation, which is driven by osmotic pressure, can give a direct measure of the timescale over which entropically stored energy is dissipated.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:27Z (GMT).

Through photographs, films, and different textual genres‚Äîtravel diary, screenplay, theoretical essay, movie criticism, novel‚ÄîI investigate the similar political role played by film in these "non-Western" avant-gardes in their relation to the idea of modernity, usually equivalent to that of the "West." I explore racial, political, and historical entanglements that emerge when debates on aesthetic form encounters the filmic medium, theorized and experienced by the so-called "non-Western" spectator. Through avant-garde films such as M√°rio Peixoto‚Äôs Limite (1930), and Kinugasa Teinosuke‚Äôs A Page of Madness (1926); the theorizations of Oct√°vio de Faria and Tanizaki Jun‚Äôichir≈ç; and the photographs and writings by M√°rio de Andrade and Murayama Tomoyoshi, this dissertation follows the clash between the desire for a universal and disembodied vision, and the encounter with filmic perception. I argue that the filmic apparatus, as a technology and a commodity, emphasizes an embodied and localized experience of vision and time that revealed the discourse on cultural-historical difference‚Äîthe distinction between West and Rest, or modern and non-modern‚Äîas a suppressive modulator of material power dynamics embedded in racial, class, and gender hierarchies enjoyed by the cosmopolitan elite in the "peripheral" spaces. The temporality of filmic perception becomes a problem for the avant-garde program of "moving forward." The dissertation is punctuated with images that traveled across national territories, building a political theory of the technical image that takes into consideration the experience of a displaced spectatorship: transnational, in racially marked bodies, and within discourses of historical belatedness. Comparing two disparate spaces through a mobile medium that represents movement, I explore the possibilities and limits of nation-bound comparison and area studies, while contributing to debates in film and media theory.

While sufficient for materials that deform primarily by means of slip, many metals may exhibit other modes of plastic deformation, and thus may not be accurately modeled by slip alone. Deformation twinning is another mode of plastic deformation, characterized by a rapid, large uniform shear of a discrete region of material, coupled with a reorientation of the crystal lattice within said region. While witnessed in metals of various crystal symmetries, metals comprised of hexagonal crystals are especially prone to exhibit twinning, as they may require twinning to accommodate generalized plasticity. Due in large part to limitations in computational capabilities, models have often ignored deformation twinning. Existing models rely on the homogenization of the responses due to both slip and twinning via a modified Taylor hypothesis, and thus fail to predict accurate local states. Additionally, these models consider twin systems as modified slip systems, obscuring the discrete nature of deformation twinning, as well as the disparity in relative speeds at which each deformation mode propagates. Advances in computational capabilities and model frameworks have allowed for the possibility to study this deformation mode in more detail. A parallelized finite element framework is uniquely suited to approach this problem, as a proven platform for modeling high fidelity, finely discretized representations of polycrystalline aggregates. A framework is presented, in which grains within a microstructure are pre-discretized - based on their crystallographic orientation - into discrete regions that may deform by deformation twinning. A boundary value problem is solved, in which the displacement of the nodes within a twin region are rapidly mapped to their twinned location, the region's crystal lattice is reoriented via three separate schemes, and the remainder of the body deforms by means of crystallographic slip to accommodate this deformation. In this way, the extended framework retains the characteristic differences between crystallographic slip and deformation twinning in a way that existing models do not. Work is calculated due to the changes in local environments due to twinning. Changes in local stress states are discussed in light of global and local work measures and various parameters, including twin size and reorientation schemes.

Its students and alumni did very well in design competitions, and went on to successful careers all over the country. When the author attended architecture school in Caracas, the majority of the faculty were Cornell alumni from the 50s. Their focus was on modernism, and when they reminisced about Cornell they talked mostly about what they learned studying Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe and Gropius, among others. For this thesis the author reviewed documents in the university‚Äôs archives and corresponded with alumni of the era, in order to look at the transitional period between those two phases in the life of the Cornell school.

This dissertation explores the underrepresentation of women in computing as a cultural issue.  After considering the role of women in the history of computing, it examines contemporary interventions to address gender bias and promote gender diversity in the tech sector and Silicon Valley.   Not for profit organizations operate as intermediaries that work to raise awareness of gender bias and facilitate institutional alignment on diversity policy and practice across corporate, academic, and the public sectors. This research used a multi-method approach that included critical discourse analysis, participant observation, and qualitative method. Moments of discourse were analyzed to reveal and illuminate dilemmas such as the phenomenon of unconscious bias and the prospect and dilemma of male allies for culture change.   Also explored was the tension between focusing on diversity metrics vs. mounting intervention to produce durable culture change the face of deeply entrenched attitudes and practices that push back overt and subtle ways.  Gendered occupational identities and biased institutional practices reverberate through the tech sector and more broadly in the structures of society.  The conclusion raises uncomfortable questions, such as whether the work on gender diversity is ever "done," and who will continue to put pressure on companies to reconcile tensions between business performance and social justice.

Additionally, many techniques used currently require the sample to be washed and dried, which can significantly alter the structure and chemistry of the interface. Finally, chemically reactive materials are present at solid-liquid interfaces in many devices, such as batteries, which makes preparation, storage, and characterization of these materials in an unaltered state challenging. In the work presented here, we describe cryogenic electron microscopy techniques that allow us to study the structure and bonding of intact solid-liquid interfaces and reactive materials at high resolution. We introduce a paired cryo-focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy technique designed to enable the native structure and elemental composition of natural and engineered interfacial layers tens of nanometers thick to be characterized on surfaces in devices. Additionally, we describe a cryo-focused ion beam technique for extracting and preparing solid-liquid interface cross sections for high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy with the liquids intact, including a method for precisely localizing features of interest without labels, even those below the sample surface in some cases. Finally, we combine these techniques to study electrode-electrolyte interfaces processes at the nanoscale in lithium metal batteries, which are promising candidates to replace lithium-ion batteries, but which are currently limited by processes that occur at these interfaces. We find that two types of dendritic lithium structures are present at the lithium anode-electrolyte interface, one which has an extended interphase layer on its surface, and the other which is composed of uniform lithium hydride, which has not been observed before. These lithium hydride dendrites may contribute disproportionately to the significant capacity fade observed in lithium metal batteries, and our findings allowed us to propose potential methods for inhibiting these dendrites, which initial experiments support. The development of the cryogenic techniques described here has thus not only allowed us to reveal never-before-seen features of solid-liquid interfaces at the nanoscale, but has enabled practical pathways toward improving lithium metal battery performance to be proposed.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:29Z (GMT).

Through case studies of three forms of Hindu chant, I show how vocal performance has been taken up‚Äîby the state, by religious authorities, and by vocalists themselves‚Äîas a tool of ethical reform and a technology of ethical striving. I argue that the voice has become a privileged medium for imagining and inhabiting new subjectivities in Bali.  	I contextualize my study of voice within a broader investigation of religion as both a disciplining force and an enabling resource in the lives of Balinese Hindus. Bringing ethnographic attention to a variety of practices through which Balinese Hindus interact with the world they call niskala, the world of invisible deities, and spirits‚Äîincluding ritual exchange, prayer, and the study and performance of religious texts, among others‚ÄîI show how human-niskala relationships are constituted through, and structured by, hegemonic institutions and discourses, while at the same time, they create spaces of possibility for individuals to engage in creative forms of self-making and world-making. By examining how these relationships are imagined and manifested across different spheres of religious authority, I shed light on the ethical pluralism of religious life in contemporary Bali.  	This study focuses on religious pedagogies of voice as a particularly productive site for investigating the coming-into-being of new kinds of selves. Because of its connection to language, and, by extension, to texts, the voice has been deployed as both an object and a tool in state-sponsored projects of religious reform in Bali, which emphasize interiority as the core of religious selfhood and foreground texts as the proper source of religious knowledge and moral guidance. Religious forms of vocal performance and training are also an important space in which sensory and affective dispositions are formed. Highlighting the sonic and bodily materiality of vocal expression, as well as its linguistic and textual aspects, I argue that the semiotic, sensory, and affective affordances of vocal performance and training play an important role in shaping the kinds of ethical selves that are imagined and cultivated in Bali today."

The production of semiconducting thin films with spatially-controlled composition has enabled various applications such as computer chips, photovoltaics, and display technologies. A decrease in film thickness to the atomic scale, a challenging limit for traditional semiconductors (such as Si and GaAs), represents the ultimate thinness limit of thin film engineering and would further advance applications such as flexible electronics. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), which form stable three-atom-thick monolayers, provide an ideal material platform for semiconducting thin film engineering in the ultimate atomic-thickness limit. The unique electronic band structures of monolayer TMDs enable remarkable functionalities of TMD monolayers, including high mobility, direct bandgap, large excitonic effect, and valleytronics. While existing experiments have been demonstrated with mechanically exfoliated samples, the full potential of monolayer TMDs cannot be realized without a method that produces these materials in a scalable manner. There are two major challenges regarding the material synthesis of TMD monolayers‚Äîlarge-scale uniform monolayer film and high-quality heterostructure within the monolayer plane. In this thesis, I present the efforts toward resolving these two challenges based on semiconducting monolayer TMDs. We first describe the synthesis of wafer-scale, high-mobility monolayer TMD films such as molybdenum disulfide. We then demonstrate coherent monolayer TMD heterostructures and superlattices, in which 4% lattice mismatched tungsten disulfide and tungsten diselenide are laterally integrated in the monolayer plane without dislocations. The lattice coherence results in a large strain which is used to precisely engineer the optical band gaps and mechanical deformation of these TMD monolayers. We further construct high-performance (opto-) electronic devices based on heterostructures with monolayer thickness. Finally, we demonstrate that monolayer TMDs can serve as atomic building blocks for creating vertically-heterostructured films containing both TMDs and non-layered materials.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:31Z (GMT).

Both applications utilize mechanical perturbation in the optical system to generate phase diversity in real-time stochastic systems. The first part of this study proposes a novel automated alignment method which improves efficiency and increases the flexibility of an optical system. Current optical systems with automated alignment capabilities are typically designed to include a dedicated wavefront sensor. Here, we demonstrate a self-aligning method for a reconfigurable system using only focal plane images. We define reconfigurable and reflective optical systems and simulate the images given misalignment parameters using ZEMAX software. We perform a principal component analysis (PCA) on the simulated dataset to obtain Karhunen-Loeve (KL) modes, which form the basis set whose weights are the system measurements. A model function which maps the state to the measurement is learned using nonlinear least squares fitting and serves as the measurement function for the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) used to estimate the state and control the system. The observability and stability of the system are discussed. We present both simulated and experimental results of the full system in operation.  The second part of this study presents a novel algorithm for phase retrieval and optical system parameter estimation. Many wavefront reconstruction techniques estimate the amplitude and phase from multiple intensity measurements. One can generate phase diversity among these intensity measurements by varying certain parameters in the optical system. These parameters are subject to noise and disturbances, which might strongly degrade the accuracy of the reconstruction. The parallel algorithm iterative amplitude and phase retrieval (APR) have been proven to accurately reconstruct arbitrary wavefronts from multiple intensity measurements when system parameters are known exactly, given the ability to induce phase diversity between images. Such sets of intensity images with phase diversity can be generated by moving a lens in the optical system, but any position error on the lens will degenerate the reconstruction result. We demonstrate the use of an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm with Kalman smoothing for recovering both the complex field and the lens position from a stack of intensity images. Our method successfully reduces the mean-squared-error of the estimated wavefront in comparison to an approach without position error estimation. We present and discuss the results of using a Kalman smoother and nonlinear least-square optimization for the estimation of the moving lens position. We modify and extend the system variable estimation method to serial phase retrieval algorithm. We present the use of iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF) to estimate the system variables in a multiple-image phase retrieval framework. An iterated extended Kalman filter is shown to effectively reduce the normalized mean-square-error of the reconstructed wavefront by estimating the defocus and transverse shifts of a moving camera in simulation. Experiments are conducted using two different test objects, and the results clearly demonstrate the enhancement of detail and contrast of the wavefront when using the filter. A quadratic phase introduced by a convex lens is used with a binary mask as one of the test objects. The focal length estimated from the unwrapped phase agrees with the (1% tolerance) value provided by the manufacturer.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:32Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Moreover, many of these training events involve non-allies and serve functions other than deterrence or preparation for war.  Why do major powers conduct military exercises with non-allies and why have these training events increased since the end of the Cold War?  Training has remained a vital military activity since the advent of war but the purpose of holding exercises has evolved over time.  States traditionally use military exercises to deter or prepare for war, yet since the end of the Cold War major powers have increasingly employed training events as a ‚Äònon-war‚Äô means to shape their strategic environments by influencing partners and rivals.  I argue that major powers conduct multinational exercises with non-allies in order to reduce strategic uncertainty; moreover, exercises have grown since the end of the Cold War due to an increase in uncertainty wrought by the rise of violent non-state actors, as well as the habitual nature of military cooperation.  This dissertation offers a novel understanding of military behavior in the post-Cold War environment in which interstate war is rare but the persistent threat and consequences of terrorism, ethnic war, transnational crime, and natural disasters seems unending.  I test my argument with both quantitative and qualitative methods using a new dataset, in-depth interviews, large-N regressions, and illustrative case studies.  This dissertation seeks to provide an update to the traditional works in military doctrine by highlighting the important role of shaping operations in the post-Cold War era and how these types of military activities affect international security.

Known as the EcoEnergy Sugar Project, the Tanzanian government granted a 99-year lease to over 20,000 hectares of coastal farmland on which thousands of rural women and men live, to a Swedish investor who promised to mobilize over USD 500 million for commercial sugarcane production. Despite enormous political support from top-level government officials, international development agencies, and financial institutions, the project has remained stalled for over a decade since its inception in 2005/6.  	Proposing to think with the heuristic of liminality‚Äîa lived experience and an ontological condition of being in-between‚Äîand the analytical sensibility of postcolonial intersectionality, the study examines the relational entanglements of the Tanzanian state, the foreign investor, and the rural women and men that have shaped the unfolding dynamics of the EcoEnergy project, against its apparent stillness or inactivity on the surface. Drawing on 18 months of visual ethnographic fieldwork in the district of Bagamoyo, it argues that the implementation of the land deal has been stymied by the convergence of political economic processes at multiple scales; the ambiguities in land tenure resulting from the legacy of previous rounds of state-led enclosures and dispossessions; as well as the determination of rural women and men to remain rooted on the land through diverse gendered strategies of everyday resistance.      	The study underscores the importance of understanding the historical, cultural, political, and ecological contexts under which contemporary land deals unfold; it demonstrates that the landscape in Bagamoyo has been a product of people‚Äôs on-going material and symbolic relationships with nonhuman natures, while being deeply enmeshed in local and global dynamics of power and capital. In shedding light on how gender, class, generation, location, and other intersecting forms of difference have shaped people‚Äôs experiences of and responses to the liminal land deal, the study also raises critical questions about the trajectories of postcolonial development and nation-building for the Tanzanian state, as well as the meaning of identity and citizenship for those living in the margins of capitalist agrarian transformation."		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:34Z (GMT).

As dress, like language, was a critical feature of organized society, the comparison of rhetorical language to dress in the classical tradition gave expression to some of the ways in which figures of speech served as ordering principles giving legible shape to ideas, but at the same time entailed a host of ideological implications that the Romantics were not the first to find troubling. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Rousseau and Wordsworth amplified the arguments of earlier pastoral and primitivist traditions by insisting that the social order that dress and eloquence represented was inherently corrupt and disfiguring. Yet in spite of their apparently anti-rhetorical stance, they did not abandon the classical tradition: by reacting against the specific comparison of language to the dress of thought, they actually entered an ongoing, trans-historical conversation about the relationship between meaning and expression, and the ways in which this relationship developed in the inescapable context of social determination. In another turn of the wheel in Romantic debates about rhetoric, Byron reacted against Wordsworthean and Rousseauvian "primitivism" and set the agenda of re-instating the civilizing "law" of literature in the realm of English letters. However, his efforts remained inconsistent because he sought to restore the "rules" while at the same time harnessing the sublime and the illimitable and embracing the protean transformations that fashion permitted. Informed by the critical discourses of the history of rhetoric, deconstruction, and cultural studies, "Poisoned Vestments" maps how these leading writers brought the material conditions of life at the turn of the nineteenth century to bear on long-standing questions of rhetorical form.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:32Z (GMT).

Regeneration requires a complex series of events including activation of skeletal muscle specific stem cells (satellite cells) followed by proliferation and differentiation of committed myoblasts [muscle progenitor cells (MPCs)], and formation/repair of functional multinucleated muscle cells. Activation of satellite cells and expansion of MPCs is essential to generate a sufficient number of viable cells to repair damaged skeletal muscle. In animal models, age is associated with reduced MPC expansion capacity in vitro. Additionally, male mouse-MPCs (mMPCs) exhibit higher proliferation rates than female mMPCs. However, the impact of age and sex on expansion of human MPCs (hMPCs) remains unknown.  To evaluate the age- and sex-related differences in expansion capacity of primary hMPCs, we compared markers of expansion between young and old, male and female primary hMPC cultures. hMPCs from older males have reduced expansion capacity compared to their younger counterparts, but hMPCs from females are largely unaffected by age. Proliferating MPCs have high energetic and biosynthetic material requirements, and the ability to utilize oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and/or glycolysis may affect the expansion capacity of MPCs. Results from our study suggest that reduced expansion capacity in OM-hMPCs is accompanied by alterations in measurements of OXPHOS while glycolysis is maintained. However, we and others have demonstrated that not all old hMPCs have impaired expansion capacity and similarly, not all young hMPCs expand better than old hMPCs.  Using K-means cluster analysis and measurements of culture population doubling time and saturation density, we are the first to unbiasedly cluster cultures with similar growth parameters and to identify drivers of expansion capacity that weren‚Äôt related to categorical age or sex. Our primary findings demonstrate that cultures with enhanced expansion capacity have DEgenes enriched in functional classifications, pathways and networks that suggest promotion of the cell cycle, reduced apoptosis and cellular senescence, and enhanced DNA replication.  Acute inflammation following muscle injury is essential to activate satellite cells. However, chronic muscle inflammation likely contributes to impaired regenerative capacity in skeletal muscle. Previous research has identified muscle inflammatory susceptibility, or the ability to manage and respond to inflammation, as a predictor of failed muscle regeneration and regrowth following surgery. We determined a transcript profile that distinguishes human muscle progenitor cell (hMPC) cultures with high and low inflammatory susceptibility. DEgene enrichment suggested that MuIS+ cells had promotion of inflammatory pathways and inhibition of muscle differentiation pathways. Novel (KISS1) and known (SMARCA4, MYOD1, IL1Œ≤) genes emerged as regulators for identified functional pathways. When compared to other transcriptomics datasets, MuIS+ cultures share overlap in transcript profiles to both individuals who do not respond to progressive resistance exercise training and to older adults with diminished muscle strength. This dissertation highlights the heterogeneity that exists between humans throughout the muscle regenerative process. Uncovering the molecular underpinnings of this heterogeneity is essential as the field of medicine moves towards a personalized approach.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:35Z (GMT).

Approaching such problems with statistical learning has allowed me to overcome some of the commonly imposed constraints and weaken some of the commonly made assumptions that prevent us from learning more about the empirical problem. By using out-of-sample validation and algorithmic model building, the first chapter presents an important step forward in making poverty targeting more accurate and efficient. The second chapter considers the theory and empirics of poverty and welfare dynamics more generally; the findings include several important implications for the study of welfare dynamics in diverse asset environments. The final chapter finds evidence consistent with a pattern in which households with greater initial asset holdings also hold a riskier portfolios and enjoy greater returns to their assets; however the analysis is limited by a poor accounting of human capital assets. The chapter concludes that allowing for the heterogeneity of assets, including non-physical assets, that may play a role in the livelihoods of households in developing countries is important. This dissertation demonstrates some of the ways in which algorithmic approaches can assist us in learning from the data.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:35Z (GMT).

Two thin-film phenomena were explored in this work: the Œ≤-to-Œ± phase transformation in tantalum thin films, and the (111)-to-(100) texture transformation in face-centered cubic metal thin films. Both are revealed to rely on specific defect structures. To understand the Œ≤-to-Œ± phase transformation in Ta films, we first investigated the nature of the metastable Œ≤ phase of tantalum. A series of Ta films was deposited in an ultra-high vacuum system under varying Ar sputter pressures to investigate the role of energetic deposition on phase formation, structure, and properties. By measuring the stress in each film, we unambiguously established that only the Œ≤ phase of Ta appears, despite large variations in deposition energy. All films exhibit (002) fiber texture, and the while the breadth of this component increased with increasing sputter pressure, no other texture component appeared. In comparing these results with a detailed review of the literature, a theory of phase selection in Ta films was formulated that is consistent with virtually all reported results. As these films consist of 100% Œ≤-Ta with no evidence of contamination with either oxygen or the stable Œ± phase, we were also able to provide representative measurements of the resistivity and Hall-Petch constants of pure Œ≤-Ta.  When annealed, these films underwent the Œ≤-to-Œ± phase transformation, and electron backscatter diffraction revealed that they formed an unusual microstructure with continuous orientation gradients and discontinuous grain boundaries. The variation in initial Œ≤-Ta microstructure resulted in substantial variation in the phase-transformed microstructure. The magnitude of the orientation gradient decreased with increasing sputter pressure, and the distance between high-angle orientation increased with increasing sputter pressure. We propose a simple rotation mechanism by which the orientation gradient might form, which is consistent with all observed variations in the gradient microstructure. Using a genetic algorithm, we identified the geometrically necessary dislocations needed to produce these orientation gradient patterns according to this mechanism. The (111)-to-(100) texture transformation is a well-known phenomenon occurring in FCC films deposited with (111) fiber texture. Upon annealing, films below some critical thickness retain (111) texture, while those above the critical thickness transform to a (100) texture. The transformation is often explained by a competition between strain energy and interface energy: thin films retain (111) texture because the (111) interface has low surface energy, while thick films transform to (100) because the (100) orientation is more compliant and therefore has a lower strain energy for a given strain. However, recent work has suggested that neither strain energy nor interface energy play a dominant role in the transformation. We investigated the driving forces involved in this transformation by using a bulge test to induce different strain energies in thin Ag films under identical annealing conditions, and observing the progression of the texture transformation using synchrotron x-ray diffraction. Despite a large change in strain energy, the applied stresses had no effect on the transformation. We therefore evaluated various defects as potential driving forces for the transformation, and show that nanotwins provide both an adequate driving force and a potential orientation selection mechanism for the (111)-to-(100) transformation.

The data sample, which was recorded during 2015 and 2016, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 38.5 fb^-1.  This search uses benchmark signal models in which long-lived particles are pair-produced and each decays into two or more quarks, leading to a signal with multiple jets and two displaced vertices composed of many tracks.  No events with two well-separated high-track-multiplicity vertices are observed.  Upper limits are placed on models of R-parity violating supersymmetry in which the long-lived particles are neutralinos or gluinos decaying solely into multijet final states or top squarks decaying solely into dijet final states.  For neutralino, gluino, or top squark masses between 800 and 2600 GeV and mean proper decay lengths between 1 and 40 mm, the analysis excludes cross sections above 0.3 fb at 95% confidence level.  Gluino and top squark masses are excluded below 2200 GeV and 1400 GeV, respectively, for mean proper decay lengths between 0.6 and 80 mm.  A method is provided for extending the results to other models with pair-produced long-lived particles.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:36Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Preliminary analysis of BIXI trip logs in 2016 shows there are similarities between the spatial distribution patterns of BIXI ridership and metro ridership, and temporal patterns of bikesharing trips indicate that some annual members are using BIXI as one of their daily commuting modes. The OLS model and the spatial lag model are used to investigate the relationship between bikesharing ridership and independent variables in transit service levels, connectivity and transport-related demographics. The 5-minute walk time buffer is chosen as the measure for the dependent variable and 12 independent variables. The log-log transformed OLS model has a 75% goodness of fit and identifies a number of variables significantly associated with BIXI ridership. In the stepwise regression model, significant variables are metro ridership, street network connectivity, daytime population, number of people that travel to work by walking, number of people that travel to work by bicycle, population aged 20 to 24 (negative), and average household expenditure on private transportation (negative).  For 10% increase in metro ridership, a 4.16% increase in BIXI ridership is expected. The highly significant Moran's I indicates strong spatial autocorrelation. LM and robust LM tests justify our choice of the spatial lag model. This study uses both GeoDa and Stata to run the spatial lag model, in order to test the model with different spatial weighting matrices. Results show that the structure of the inverse distance matrix in Stata is more suitable for representing spatial interactions in bikesharing trips between metro buffers. Metro ridership is highly significant and is the second strongest predictor. After removing spatial effects, 10 percent increase in metro ridership is associated with 5.44 percent increase in BIXI ridership. In both the OLS model and the spatial lag model, metro ridership, street network connectivity, number of people that travel to work by walking and number of people that travel to work by bicycle are positively associated with BIXI ridership. This result indicates that transit riders and active travelers are potential users of bikesharing services. Through collaborative and intermodal planning, the relationship between bikeshare and transit could be strengthened and bikeshare could fulfill its potential to be a powerful complement to public transit.

Location is the most important factor in determining housing prices. However, in multi-unit residential markets, two housing units in one building share the same location but may still have different transaction prices. The first chapter is to explore why. To identify the explanatory factors, the author collects over 200,000 transaction records from 2012-2016 in Beijing and provides rich and valid empirical evidence. Also, this chapter proposes a least nugget effects estimator (LNE) as an alternative to the conventional fixed effects estimator (FE). LNE is essentially a pairwise differences estimator (PD) whose comparison with FE in linear fixed effects models is studied in the second chapter. The second focus of this dissertation is a type of households who are both home buyer and home seller at the same time (called "buy-sellers"). The traditional framework would model such households as two independent identities. However, this dichotomic tradition ignores the essential feature of the buy-sellers, that is, the interdependence between buying and selling decisions. As a buyer, a new purchase depends on a successful sale due to budget and policy restrictions; as a seller, a sale may rely on the success in bidding to avoid renting for a living. This interdependence results in a connected bidding network. One‚Äôs success or failure in bidding or selling will influence others‚Äô. Chapter three, for the first time, studies this type of households and proposes an agent-based model (ABM) with buy-sellers. Then, the author uses this ABM to analyze the effects of housing purchase restrictions and home brokerage on market outcomes.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:38Z (GMT).

These waste streams, rich in sugars, proteins, and lipids, can be transformed into value-added products.  Enzymes provide a selective and greener route of synthesis, but lack stability in extreme environments, and the ability to be reused.  Therefore, the present work studied immobilized enzymes for practical application in two major waste streams:  oil and dairy.  First, lipase B from Candida antarctica (E.C. 3.1.1.3) was immobilized within cross-linked microparticles (CLMP) displaying varying scales of support, and the influence of these nano- and macroscale support materials on lipase activity and stability was studied.  Kinetic analysis and extreme environment testing revealed that that polydicyclopentadiene macrostructure had the greatest influence on stability.  These CLMPs successfully produced surfactants from lauric acid and D-glucose.  However, the ~10 ¬µm particles were unrecoverable from viscous solvents.  Next, lipase was immobilized into macroscale, polymerized high internal phase emulsions (HIPE) to facilitate ease of handling.  After fabrication, HIPEs displayed an increase in activity (139¬±9.7%) over native lipase.  However, lipase was weakly immobilized, and retained less than 10% relative activity after 5 washes.  HIPEs retained above 40% relative activity after exposure to pH 3, 7, and 10 for 24 hours, effectively expanding the working range of lipase.  HIPEs also displayed an increase in relative activity after storage at 20 ÀöC and 40 ÀöC for 24 hours and retained greater than 40% activity after storage in 50 ÀöC and 60 ÀöC for 24 hours.  These macroscale HIPEs were recoverable from reaction media but require further optimization to increase protein retention.  Finally, Œ≤-galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae (E.C. 3.2.1.23) and glucose isomerase (E.C. 5.3.1.5) were co-immobilized within a cross-linked enzyme aggregate (combi-CLEA) for dairy waste upcycling.  The Œ≤-galactosidase within the combi-CLEA retained approximately 10% activity after immobilization, but activity was unable to be detected from glucose isomerase.  Additional optimization of the combi-CLEA is necessary before application testing in whey permeate.  Applications-based approaches to enzyme immobilization are necessary to create low-cost, industrially relevant catalysts.  Through the understanding of support material influences, and extreme environment testing, enzymes have the potential to increase the overall sustainability of food processing.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:38Z (GMT).

This industry has also been criticized for exploitative labor practices. When surveyed, consumers have reported preferences for environmentally and socially responsible clothing, yet they have continued to seek low-cost, low-quality clothing that belies their good intentions. Among sustainable clothing scholarship and activism there has been broad, but untested consensus that increasing consumer knowledge among the general population about sustainable clothing will promote sustainable clothing consumption. Academics, activists, and concerned social entrepreneurs have spent their efforts creating a variety of online sustainable clothing consumer knowledge resources without empirical proof that consumer knowledge influences consumer behavior, and there are no best practices that have been established. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of one online sustainable clothing consumer knowledge platform, ProjectJUST.com, in promoting sustainable clothing consumption among Millennials. Quantitative survey results and qualitative interview findings were analyzed to this end. Survey results collected from two groups of respondents, one that had used ProjectJUST.com (n = 700) and one that had not (n = 685). Survey results suggested that people who accessed ProjectJUST.com already intended to buy sustainable clothing when they landed on the website because the content was personally relevant to their expressions of identity as more sustainable consumers. Qualitative data were derived from 3 interviews spaced over 6-months with 35 Millennials. Findings suggested that ProjectJUST.com had little appeal for this study‚Äôs participants. Participants preferred to receive information about their clothing from sources that they already used, such as social media, or word-of-mouth. Participants were then segmented based on the changes they reported to their clothing consumption behaviors over the study period into four groups: maintainers, preparers, contemplators, and precontemplators. Differentiated social marketing strategies were recommended, and implications for online sustainable clothing consumer knowledge platforms were presented throughout to offer strategies that can improve the efficacy of such platforms in changing behavior.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:39Z (GMT).

However, such status effects of communication medium are often complicated by the evolving features of communication technologies and the changing practices of mediated communication. This dissertation explores theoretical principles behind the apparently myriad possibilities of effects of communication medium on status development in problem-solving groups. This is approached from different angles with two laboratory studies. The first study (Chapter 2) examines the medium effects on group members‚Äô perception of each other‚Äôs expertise, with respect to how they match each other‚Äôs language use (i.e., linguistic accommodation) in group interactions. The findings suggest that linguistic accommodation channels people‚Äôs hidden confidence about task performance into interpersonal perception of performance (i.e., rankings of expertise). This language-based process can be affected by medium features that modulate the salience of confidence cues and language use (e.g., text-chat vs face-to-face discussion). The second study (Chapter 3) focuses on individuals‚Äô selective attention‚Äîa prevalent issue of technology design. The study particularly examines selective attention to task objects and social objects in group interactions, along with two behavioral mechanisms‚Äîperformance expectation and physiological stress‚Äîof status differentiation. The study found selective attention interplays with physiological stress in predicting the status outcome (i.e., deference and resistance to social influence). Thus, the findings suggest that effects of communication medium on status development can be partly understood through the technological modulation of selective attention and the subsequent effects on certain behavioral mechanisms of status differentiation.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:39Z (GMT).

In this work, these figures of merit were utilized to support the orbit selection process used during Pre-Phase A and Phase A studies for the NASA-funded Time-Resolved Observations of Precipitation structure and storm Intensity (TROPICS) mission. Thousands of potential constellations were defined, simulated and compared with each other according to different mission coverage requirements. The sensitivity and robustness of figures of merit to various hypothetical operational failures (e.g., loss of one satellite or one launch) was systematically measured. A deployment strategy based on differential drag was described and analyzed. Finally, the orbital lifetime of various architectures was also studied with respect to NASA's 25 years de-orbiting recommendation. The contributions of this work include: (1) an exhaustive analysis of figures of merit commonly used in Earth observation orbit design, including a new metric called Continuous High-Revisit Coverage, which captures the long coverage gaps left by string-of-pearls constellations. (2) A methodology to assess robustness of constellations based on a brute-force disjoint scenario simulation approach (3) Results and recommendations from the mission analysis process for the TROPICS mission.

However, the attitudes and feedbacks of consumers with different shopping values towards this trend were not being studied. The purpose of this research is to understand the impact of interactive technology features in the sports retail environments on consumers‚Äô perception and behavior in the shopping environment. To investigate the impact, a between-subjects experiment was conducted with 61 college students using 3D simulation technology. Participants were first asked to complete a survey regarding their individual shopping value (hedonistic/utilitarian), and after the virtual shopping experience, their emotional and cognitive perceptions and shopping behavioral intentions asked. Their responses were analyzed to compare the experience under two distinct store conditions. The findings of this research will help both researchers and retailers understand and integrate interactive technology efficiently to optimize customers‚Äô shopping experience.

Chapter one provides an introduction and motivation for the role of parents in the transition to adulthood. Chapter two (with Sharon Sassler) examines whether adolescent reports of maternal closeness and parental control are associated with youth‚Äôs likelihood of being in an interracial relationship in emerging adulthood. We find that parental factors do influence emerging adults‚Äô romantic relationships, and that they vary by race, ethnicity, and gender. Among White men, reports of maternal closeness in adolescence reduce the likelihood of being in an interracial relationship in emerging adulthood. Parental control elevates the odds of being in an interracial or interethnic relationship among Black and Hispanic women. We also find that parental decisions on where families live shape offspring‚Äôs choices, as growing up in more diverse census tracts in adolescence is associated with interracial union formation in later life. Chapter three examines the roles of school disconnectedness and maternal relationship quality in shaping depressive symptoms from adolescence to emerging adulthood, and variations across race and ethnicity. School disconnectedness in adolescence is associated with increased depressive symptoms in emerging adulthood. Maternal warmth and communication in adolescence is also associated with decreased depressive symptoms, but only among White and Hispanic emerging adults. Maternal warmth and communication moderates the association between school disconnectedness and depressive symptoms in emerging adulthood, showing that it is an important protective factor for mental health in the transition to adulthood. Chapter four examines how individual attitudes and parent-child relationships in adolescence are associated with the likelihood of having a non-marital birth in emerging and in young adulthood. I find that individual attitudes about non-marital fertility predict the likelihood of having a non-marital birth among all women. Among minority women, I find that higher levels of maternal warmth and communication are associated with a decreased likelihood of having a non-marital birth in young adulthood. In particular, maternal warmth and communication in adolescence is associated with a decreased likelihood of having a non-marital birth in young adulthood among Black and Asian women. Chapter five concludes the dissertation and provides limitations and future directions. Collectively, this dissertation provides evidence that parent-child relationships in adolescence shape demographic outcomes in emerging and in young adulthood, and vary across race, ethnicity, and gender.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:41Z (GMT).

The first chapter deepens understanding of the effect of immigration on native wages in a setting where offshoring also takes place. It does so by relaxing restrictive assumptions of existing theoretical models on the nature of offshoring and showing that if a greater share of native than immigrant tasks is offshored, offshoring reinforces the impact of immigration. Using spatial approach and instrumental variable strategy to address potential endogeneity, empirical results show that the U.S. commuting zones that experienced greater offshoring change featured a magnified effect of immigration on wages of low-skilled native workers. The second chapter contributes to the economics literature by showing that immigrants can affect trade not just with their countries of origin, but also certain third party countries, and investigating which immigrants do that as well as the likely channels. The study provides evidence of both an inter-ethnic spillover effect (through the role of common spoken non-native language and geographic proximity) as a well as a special role of ethnic ties (through additional effect of common native language). The magnitude of the trade promotion effect of some third party country immigrant groups is comparable to the trade promotion effect of immigrants from trading partner country. The third chapter examines determinants of international differences in agricultural labor productivity. In particular, it focuses on the role of farm size distribution and policy distortions. The findings suggest that international labor productivity differences are mostly explained by differential input quantity and quality, while average farm size and farm size distribution do not have a significant effect  conditional on input quantity and quality. This suggests that even if there is misallocation in the form of suboptimal input use in poor countries with smaller farms, it is likely less severe than suggested by hypotheses that assume larger farms are overall more productive. Additionally, price distortions analyzed do not appear to explain either farm size or productivity differences.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:42Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Nevertheless, even if a fishing moratorium is a policy option that should be reserved only for the most dire of circumstances, it is useful to understand the economic consequences both of potentially failing to prevent such a worst-case scenario, and having already mismanaged fisheries to the point of collapse. 		 In this Master's thesis, we develop a bioeconomic model to evaluate the optimality of a fishing moratorium when costs to labor and capital are taken into consideration. We first present our model analytically, drawing parallels and distinctions between the optimal Faustmann-Wicksell forest rotation and optimal fishery moratorium with ex gratia unemployment relief and vessel depreciation payments, deriving an analytic solution for the case of logistic growth, and extending the model to allow for time-varying prices. We subsequently apply our model to a numerical case study of the ongoing moratorium instituted on the Northern Atlantic cod fishery off the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador beginning in 1992.  		 Under our model and baseline parameter assumptions calibrated to fishery conditions in 1992, we find that the cod moratorium is economically inefficient if the option value of the alternative ``business-as-usual'' policy to refrain from imposing a moratorium is zero: the costs of annual ex gratia unemployment relief significantly outweigh the benefits of increased revenues from greater sustainable post-moratorium harvests. The cod moratorium may become optimal if (i) the intrinsic growth rate of the Northern cod stock is sufficiently high; (ii) the anticipated future net dockside price of cod is sufficiently high; (iii) the social discount rate is sufficiently low; (iv) the unemployment benefits paid to fishermen during the moratorium are sufficiently low; or (v) the option value of the alternative ``business-as-usual'' no moratorium policy is severely negative, possibly owing to the risk of potential collapse or even extinction of the stock. However, in the baseline scenario, when compared to an alternative ``business-as-usual'' policy with an expected economic value of zero, the cod moratorium remains economically inefficient even with cod prices that vary or are forecast using actual price data from Newfoundland over 1990-2016."		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:42Z (GMT).

An ancient literary genre defined by its magical and wondrous themes, romance became increasingly discredited with the rise of Protestant attacks on superstition. The new science of Francis Bacon and his successors also attacked the core subject matter of the romance genre. Despite these developments, romance persisted in early modern England both as a genre and as a formal principle. This formal principle of romance expressed itself in opulent literary style, which Bacon famously decried as "Pygmalion's frenzy," as well as in the formation of knowledge from everyday organic phenomena. I connect this formal principle of romance to the nurture of magic and Aristotelian science in texts that sought to discredit them. In these ways, romance became an opulent repository of lapsed forms from which poets and scientists drew. This dissertation focuses on four organic phenomena and their fabulous history in early modern England. In Chapter 1, I show how crystals, the "clear and pellucid" mediums of Newtonian optics, had a far earthier history that emphasized the fact that they grow in the soil and are prone to breakage. Romance helps us understand how these aspects of crystals yielded useful knowledge, just as their Newtonian clarity did. In Chapter 2, I discuss the literary and scientific reception of another "clarifying" organism: the mythical herb moly, which Homer's Ulysses uses to resist Circe's enchantments in The Odyssey. This chapter examines how the afterlife of moly showcases the vegetable power of the original myth in which it was fostered. In Chapter 3, I I discuss how enticing food and succulent language alike were targets for early modern attacks on idolatry. These attacks, however, often ended up reaffirming the value of the knowledge to be gained from eating. Chapter 4 studies how roses became historically knowing icons in both literary texts and experimental science. The iconicity of roses endowed texts with visual opulence and supersitious content. In sum, romance may have survived in early modern England because of its persistent affinities with the organic realm.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:44Z (GMT).

Their use has been significantly hampered by poor thermal properties; poly(lactic acid), arguably the most abundant aliphatic polyester, has a glass-transition temperature (Tg) of only 60‚Äì65 ¬∞C. The traditional synthesis of aliphatic polyesters ‚Äì ring-opening polymerization of lactones and lactide derivatives ‚Äì is partially responsible for the slow development of improved materials as it is challenging to make meaningful structural modifications to those monomers. The alternating copolymerization of epoxides and cyclic anhydrides offers an alternative route to polyesters, and has numerous advantages over the ring opening polymerization of lactones, including a wider range of monomers and the ability to easily make structural modifications to monomers that will greatly impact polymer properties and which allow for facile functionalization. In this work, catalyst development for the copolymerization of epoxides and anhydrides is reported, focusing on a mechanistic study, an investigation into the effects of electronic variations of the ligand on catalyst rate and selectivity, and the development of a reversible-deactivation system with superior polymerization control. Additionally, the application of these catalyst systems for the synthesis of high-Tg aliphatic functionalizable polyesters, and their use in post-polymerization modification reactions and in reprocessable crosslinked networks is reported.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:43Z (GMT).

The setting of the research is western Kenya, a densely populated area where agriculture is the primary economic activity. Many of the farms in the area are very small, often only one acre, and the lack of effective fertilizer and other input use has contributed to crop yields far below potential. The essays in this dissertation seek to determine whether information regarding agroforestry practices and soil nutrient levels can be effective tools for economic development,  and, additionally, analyze the effect. the effect of information spread through peer networks on agricultural productivity. The first essay (Chapter 2) focuses on the potential of agroforestry to reverse environmental degradation in Kenya by increasing tree coverage and providing a renewable source of household fuelwood. The results show that the various sources of fuelwood, such as collecting fuelwood from off the farm and producing it on the farm through agroforestry, are not readily substituted by households in western Kenya, primarily due to gender-specific labor roles within households. As a result, there is an effective limit on the extend of agroforestry in the area unless gender norms for household labor change. In Chapter 3, we analyze the effect of soil information transfers on household agricultural input demand by sampling soils from small-scale farms in western Kenya. After testing the soils and returning the soil nutrient results to farmers, we used experimental auctions both before and after the farmers received the results to measure changes in agricultural input demand. We find that soil testing and input recommendations do have a significant effect on farmer input demands, though the results are heterogeneous by input type and gender. Chapter 4 analyzes peer network effects on agricultural productivity in western Kenya. We find that female peers tend to increase male farmer's productivity, and hypothesize that this is due to the higher levels of social capital (proxied by network centrality) found among men in the village samples, which increases their bargaining power with those less central in the networks (often women). The three essays point to the important role of gender in resource allocation, social dynamics, and factors influencing agricultural productivity in western Kenya. Overall, this dissertation shows both the opportunities of information diffusion for further economic development in Kenya, but also the challenges posed by cultural norms that limit the spread of productivity enhancing information.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:44Z (GMT).

Headwater streams, which are the smallest and most abundant streams, are critical components of drainage systems, connecting important terrestrial and aquatic biogeochemical cycles and influencing the nutrient dynamics of downstream ecosystems.  Given the importance of water presence and movement as a driver of biogeochemical transformations and the transport of material from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems, the primary goal of this research was to quantify the distribution across and movement of water and other elements through a forested watershed to a headwater stream and ultimately to an inland lake in the glacial drift landscape of northern Michigan, U.S.A.  To investigate the temporal dynamics and spatial patterns of water across the watershed and in Honeysuckle Creek, stream discharge, shallow groundwater levels, soil moisture, and water chemistry were measured from 2015‚Äì2017.  Along the stream, surface flow was seasonal in the main stem and perennial flow was spatially discontinuous for all but the lowest reaches.  Spring snowmelt was the dominant hydrological event in the year with peak flows an order of magnitude larger than annual mean discharge.  Topography and soil characteristics strongly influence water and dissolved matter movement through the landscape.  Water presence across the watershed was highly variable with perennial soil saturation and shallow groundwater within 10 cm of the surface at the lowest landscape positions, low soil moisture and nonexistent groundwater in upland outwash ecosystems, and a mixture of these conditions in the heterogeneous till parent material ecosystems of middle landscape positions.  Shallow groundwater was the primary source of water to the headwater stream throughout the year; originating from snowmelt in the spring and shifting to recent precipitation in summer and autumn seasons.  The riparian areas and the outwash-lake plain wetland likely have a much stronger influence on stream chemistry and discharge than the upland landscape units, due to the perennial connections between shallow groundwater from these wetland areas and surface water.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:45Z (GMT).

Trust requires strength to endure bad news cycles and positively influence people's thinking and behavior. Research in risk communication, however, has rarely examined how to attain these outcomes indicative of the strength of trust. In Chapters 2 through 4, I challenge influential theories in risk communication which assume that trust is an inherently simple heuristics-based judgment to argue that trust judgments can vary in the level of cognitive effort and the amount of supporting knowledge. After discussing how the localness of the environmental issue I selected for this research helps foster strong forms of trust, I present findings from a two-wave survey revealing the strength-related attributes of trust. Hypothesis tests yielded strong evidence showing that engagement in communication processes relevant to the issue (i.e., direct communication with risk managers, use of local news media, interpersonal discussion about the issue) helped build objective knowledge, perceived knowledge, elaboration, and certainty in trust toward the judgment targets. In addition, these strength-related attributes significantly predicted the strength-defining consequences of trust (i.e., persistence, resistance, impact on information processing and behavioral intentions), accounting for unique variance beyond what was explained by trust alone.  Focusing on a different type of social judgment, Chapter 5 discusses how people judge others‚Äô right to have representation in and influence on the focal issue, judgments which I refer to as perceived standing. This chapter explores the possible attitudinal and motivational antecedents driving these judgments. In the survey, participants expressed perceptions about the standing of members from other relatively distant communities. Reflecting peoples‚Äô motivation to have more allies and fewer opponents in the issue, attitudes toward the project and beliefs about the project‚Äôs risks and benefits predicted perceived standing. However, perceived similarity with the targets, place attachment, and perceptions of oneself being underrepresented in the issue also affected perceived standing, accounting for unique variance. The final Chapter 6 discusses implications of these findings and directions for future research.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:46Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

And he argues that it is through this act of "self-examination" that we come to form the "basic certainties of consciousness" (59). Confession, a species of testimony, is a technology of subjectivity that has undergone a particular modern turn constituted as a mode of autonomous self-expression. I contend that this modern turn is analogous with the relatively recent rise of the form of quotation and reported speech. Whether it is about myself, an event, or someone else, testimony always employs some configuration of reported speech, most importantly reported "inner" speech. Consequently, accurate testimony becomes a matter of finding the closest and most approximate calibration to this inner truth. I argue that Asian American women‚Äôs writing, particularly when it tries to bear witness to a traumatic history, demands an account of testimony that arises from within a relation of address, rather than from within an individual‚Äôs singular experience. From Maxine Hong Kingston‚Äôs The Woman Warrior, Nora Okja Keller‚Äôs Comfort Woman, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha‚Äôs DICTEE, to Yoko Tawada‚Äôs Memoirs of a Polar Bear, I read primarily Asian American texts that are transpacific in scope. These texts are narrated by multiple generations of women who must contend with the dislocation of migration and a history of violence. Entangled Testimonies insists that testimony and its relationship to historical redress must necessarily come from the point of view of difference with regard to hybridity, translation, race, and women‚Äôs writing. Drawing on the Bakhtinian notion of heteroglossia, Entangled Testimonies puts forward a theory of testimony that is "entangled, shot through with shared thoughts" and "the alien words of others." In doing so, it disrupts the Euro-centric concept of the individual and the schema of proof that is at the heart of modern forms of testimony. Testimony emerges not as the monadic expression of discrete, autonomous subjectivity but instead as the entangled and shared expression of a set of social relations. By arguing for more expansive forms of testimony, Entangled Testimonies asks: how can the traumas of migration, embedded in a larger history of violence, be reopened?

The main insights of this work highlight opportunities to improve modeling of complex multi-purpose water reservoir systems and opportunities to flexibly incorporate emerging demands and hydro-climatic uncertainty. Additionally, algorithm diagnostics contributed in this work enable the water resources field to better capitalize on the rapid growth in computational power. This opens new opportunities to increase the scope of the problems that can be solved and contribute to the robustness and sustainability of water systems management worldwide. This dissertation focuses on a multi-purpose reservoir system that captures the contextual and mathematical difficulties confronted in a broad range of global multi-purpose systems challenged by multiple competing demands and uncertainty. The first study demonstrates that advances in state of the art multiobjective evolutionary optimization enables to reliably and effectively find control policies that balance conflicting tradeoffs for multi-purpose reservoir control. Multiobjective evolutionary optimization techniques coupled with direct policy search can reliably and flexibly find suitable control policies that adapt to multi-sectorial water needs and to hydro-climatic uncertainty. The second study demonstrates the benefits of cooperative parallel MOEA architectures to reliably and effectively find many objective control policies when the system is subject to uncertainty and computational constraints. The more advanced cooperative, co-evolutionary parallel search expands the scope of problem difficulty that can be reliably addressed while facilitating the discovery of high quality approximations for optimal river basin tradeoffs. The insights from this chapter should enable water resources analysts to devote computational efforts towards representing reservoir systems more accurately by capturing uncertainty and multiple demands when properly using parallel coordinated search. The third study extended multi- purpose reservoir control to better capture flood protection.  A risk-averse formulation contributed to the discovery of control policies that improve operations during hydrologic extremes. Overall this dissertation has carefully evaluated and advanced the Evolutionary Multiobjective Direct Policy Search (EMODPS) framework to support multi-objective and robust management of conflicting demands in complex reservoir systems.

Paramount to understanding and controlling this "order" is to have good "order parameters", variables that can be used to track the changes occurring in the system as it transitions from disorder to order. Some common phases that block copolymers form include the lamellar, cylinder and gyroid network. In this paper, we use molecular dynamics to simulate the growth of these phases from an isotropic liquid. A binary nanoparticle mixture model is used that allows the simulation of systems with large enough sizes for the desired phase to nucleate and grow. We develop local order parameters based on particle symmetries and geometrical constraints that can identify and track the nucleation and growth of ordered domains along the transition pathway. We put forth a framework that could be extended towards understanding the self-assembly of other bicontinuous phases such as the double diamond or plumber‚Äôs nightmare, as well as prove useful in estimating free energy barriers and nucleation rates using rare-event sampling techniques.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:49Z (GMT).

Risky and complicated dynamic decisions are virtually unavoidable in health and property insurance contexts, and these studies help us to gain a greater understanding of how individuals respond and their underlying  preferences. In Chapter 1, I examine prescription-drug purchasing behavior of enrollees in Medicare Part D, and in particular I study the extent to which their behavior changes in anticipation of uncertain but predictable changes in insurance-coverage generosity. I develop a simple heuristic model that illustrates how enrollees ought to behave. The model predicts that any changes in spending should be smooth and occur far in advance of changes in insurance-coverage generosity (except at the end of the year). I then find empirical evidence that enrollees do anticipate and respond more optimally to the Medicare Part D pricing schedule than suggested by prior literature. In Chapter 2, with coauthors, I conduct a novel experiment to understand how risk preferences in insurance contexts differ between the lab and the field. We employ an experimental setting to identify objective versus subjective beliefs and to evaluate how ambiguity might contribute to those beliefs. We find that, similar to prior work using field data, subjects are virtually risk-neutral and probability distortions are an important factor to explain behavior; however, there is more heterogeneity in probability distortions in the lab. We further find that subjects respond to ambiguity by making less risky choices, and their preferences may be consistent with  maxmin utility. Finally, in Chapter 3, with coauthors, I examine the stability of risk preferences across contexts involving different stakes. Using data on households‚Äô deductible choices in three property-insurance coverages and their limit choices in two liability- insurance coverages, we assess the stability across the five contexts in the ordinal ranking of the households‚Äô willingness to bear risk. We find evidence of stability across contexts involving stakes of the same magnitude, but not across contexts involving stakes of very different magnitudes. Our results appear to be robust to heterogeneity in wealth and access to credit.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:50Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

By such approach, directional sensors can obtain information about the target's relative orientation, in addition to its distance. Common applications include cameras mounted on autonomous vehicles that may be used for urban surveillance or target recognition by means of on-board computer vision algorithms. One of the major challenges in planning the motion of directional mobile sensors is that an important target of interest may be occluded by the presence of obstacles in the sensor's line-of-sight.  This thesis addresses this path-planning problem for an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) equipped with a vision sensor for the purpose of classifying multiple static targets in an obstacle-populated environment. An approach is developed for determining a UGV path that enables observations from all targets with known locations in minimum time. The approach guarantees that the UGV is able to classify every target previously localized, while avoiding collisions with obstacles and occlusions that prevent line-of-sight visibility. The approach consists of mapping targets into the UGV configuration space, thus obtaining C-targets, using complexity reduction techniques that take into account shadow regions caused by the presence of obstacles. An information roadmap method (IRM) algorithm is used to build a connectivity graph from the C-target regions, and a solution with the least translation distance is obtained. Comprehensive simulations performed in MATLAB and Webots - a professional robot simulator that provides modules for sensors, robots, and their interactions with a 3-D virtual environment - demonstrate the effectiveness and performance improvement of the proposed approach when compared to existing methods, based on "nearest neighbor" and classical traveling salesman problem (TSP) algorithms.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:51Z (GMT).

Philpot, William Douglas||Warner, Derek H.	2018-10-22T18:45:52Z			8/30/18		The presence of Arctic sea ice currently limits surface ship travel in the Arctic for most of the year. However, due to rising temperatures from global climate change, Arctic waters are becoming increasingly navigable for a greater percentage of the year. As interest in surface travel within the Arctic increases in the coming years, the safety of a ship operating in this context must be considered. Specifically, the possibility of ice accumulation on the topside of a ship is heightened due to environmental factors within the Arctic, including the presence of sleet, snow, freezing rain, and freezing spray. This additional mass on exposed topside surfaces, at the most extreme, could result in capsizing of a vessel.  The present research develops a framework to monitor evolving mass properties for a ship in Arctic operation, in order to ensure safe travel through the Arctic. As with any real-world application, the data for this work are limited and noisy, and the system is complex. When the real-world data are limited, when the signals of interest are noisy, or when mechanistic models are unavailable, stochastic inference can enable informed decision making regarding the natural and built worlds. Thus, this work leverages stochastic inference in order to investigate the real-world problem of Arctic travel.  First, the dissertation presents a proof-of-concept for applying this framework to identify a single mass parameter for the Research Vessel (R/V) Melville with no icing and in quiescent seas, both at model-scale and full-scale. Second, the framework is extended to consider multiple mass parameters of the R/V Melville while undergoing potential ice build-up configurations.  The third component of the dissertation looks outwards to the sea, to gauge the near-field wave forcing acting on the ship. In particular, the present work reports on a validation experiment of an existing algorithm to determine scale and sea state from an uncalibrated camera.  Taken together, the chapters prepare a foundation from which an ice monitoring system could be implemented. The chapters also provide insight to the specific challenges that exist for the full realization of the proposed framework. While the presence of ice is a focus of this work, the framework could easily be translated to a ship operating in within a context in which any mass property is evolving; those systems may require the monitoring of different mass parameters, but the underlying framework and approach proposed here would remain unchanged.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:52Z (GMT).

As such, vorticity can be potentially harmful, as seen in the hazard posed by strong counter-rotating vortex pairs generated behind aircraft in flight. Conversely, the production of strong vortical wakes is beneficial to birds and fish, which exploit their generation to produce thrust. In this work, we will examine two classes of flows in which vorticity plays a key role. In the first flow, we simulate the trailing vortex pair of an aircraft in a water tank. Such counter-rotating vortex pairs are commonly observed to undergo an instability involving a sinusoidal displacement, which ultimately leads to the generation of a series of large vortex rings. As these trailing vortices are most dangerous when aircraft are in close proximity, such as near the ground, we study the behavior of this instability when it is interrupted by a solid wall. In the presence of the wall, the interaction between the primary vortex pair and secondary vorticity generated in the boundary layer leads to significant topological changes and the production of arrays of smaller-scale vortex rings, the precise configuration of which depends on the extent of development of the instability before wall interaction. In the second flow, we examine the behavior of an airfoil oscillating with pitching and heaving motions. Many animal studies have shown that such flapping airfoils enable high agility and are also quite effective in producing thrust. Similar vehicles are under development for applications such as search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and reconnaissance. In order to reduce weight and complexity of the propulsive mechanism, however, we equip the airfoil with an actuator in the heave direction but allow it to pitch passively under the control of a torsion spring. In this system, variation of the spring stiffness and the chordwise pivot location allows control of the vortex wake produced by the airfoil, enabling it to produce either thrust or drag as desired. If these parameters are well selected, performance can even be comparable to that of a system with two actively controlled degrees of freedom. Finally, the majority of existing studies of flapping airfoils use a fixed incoming flow velocity, achieved either by towing the vehicle at a constant speed or by placing it in a water channel. This imposed velocity does not necessarily correspond to that at which the vehicle would naturally travel, determined by a balance of the vehicle's drag and the thrust produced by the airfoil. Using a cyber-physical fluid dynamics technique, in which force-feedback determines the acceleration of the airfoil in real time, we can simulate self-propulsion for a wide range of heaving and pitching amplitudes. For a given cruising velocity, we determine the combination of pitch and heave that enables the most efficient propulsion and examine the characteristics of the forces and vorticity produced that correspond to this condition.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:53Z (GMT).

This dissertation explores both aspects of forage quality estimation with one chapter investigating laboratory methods to estimate forage quality and two chapters that delve into primary collection of forage quality data during a feeding trial in rural India.  The objective of Chapter 2 is to compare in vitro long digestion methods and rates of digestion for a varied selection of diverse forages from both temperate and tropical climates. The conventional flask method with a pore size of 2.5 ¬µm was compared with ANKOM F57 that has a pore size of 25 ¬µm and ANKOM F58 bags that had an 8-10 ¬µm pore size for in vitro long digestions that last 240 hours. Method pore size was highly correlated with undigested fiber at 240 hours. Chapters 3 and 4 present data from a research project undertaken between May and December 2016 in Odisha, India. There was one main project with multiple research questions that are detailed in two chapters of this dissertation. The first objective of the project was to explore how goat management decisions impact animal health and the environment. Results found that the metabolizable energy of pasture forages was low, and there was a high proportion of non-native species. Goats graze repeatedly in the same grazing areas, which was exacerbating land management concerns already complicated by deforestation and conversion to agricultural purposes. The second objective, detailed in Chapter 4, was to research the impact of goat intensification through semi-stall-fed production on goat health, kid survival, and farmer adoption interest. Kid survivability was 4.26 times greater in the semi-stall-fed group than in the control group. Kid mortality decreased by 22.5% in the supplemented group (9.1%) compared to the control group. Sixty-three percent of participating farmers were interested to supplement their goats after the project‚Äôs conclusion.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:56Z (GMT).

Often, the main challenges are inherently computational: the problems are well understood from a purely statistical perspective, but key statistical primitives -- likelihood ratios, Bayes-optimal estimators, etc. -- are intractable to compute on large and high-dimensional data sets. We develop a unified approach to algorithm design for statistical inference based on the Sum of Squares method, a powerful tool for convex programming with low-degree polynomials, which generalizes linear programming and spectral algorithms. We use this approach to design algorithms for a range of high-dimensional statistical problems, improving on state-of-the-art provable guarantees in several well-studied settings: clustering data from high-dimensional mixture models, community detection in random graphs, and more. We also prove computational lower bounds for some statistical problems, including the long-studied planted clique problem. Our lower bounds provide new strong evidence for the existence of information-computation gaps -- that is, statistical problems which are solvable given infinite computational resources, but not by efficient algorithms. In particular, we prove new lower bounds against the powerful Sum of Squares hierarchy of semidefinite programs, via a new technique called "pseudocalibration". Because the Sum of Squares hierarchy has provable guarantees matching those of most known techniques in algorithm design for inference, our lower bounds strongly suggest that the problems we study are intractable for polynomial-time algorithms. At very least, improving existing algorithms for them would require a major breakthrough. We show that polynomial-size semidefinite programs from the Sum of Squares hierarchy cannot refute the existence of cliques of size much less than the square root of n in n-node random graphs. Additionally, we prove a lower bound for sparse principal component analysis (PCA), showing that subexponential-size Sum of Squares semidefinite programs are needed to improve on the provable guarantees of existing spectral algorithms for sparse PCA. Our approach to algorithms and lower bounds suggests a new method to chart the edge of algorithmic tractability for statistical inference. We propose a classification of Bayesian inference problems according to solvability by algorithms which compute only simple statistics of input data -- triangle counts of graphs, top eigenvalues of matrices, etc. Our classification accurately predicts suspected information-computation gaps for many well-studied problems, including planted clique, planted constraint satisfaction, community detection in stochastic block models, component analysis problems, and more. This type of classification is novel for inference problems, and represents the first approach to trace the information-computation gaps in of all these problems to the same underlying mathematical structure.

Interestingly, a single gene, optix, has been shown to be responsible for the red coloring of these as well as many other butterflies within the Lepidoptera order. Optix is a highly conserved transcription factor with ancestral function in Drosophila eye development, so how has this gene evolved its function in butterfly wing pigmentation? Here, I describe work I did to elucidate both the upstream and downstream actors of the Optix network in the Heliconius wing pigmentation pathway in an effort to provide insight into how this novel function of optix has evolved. First, I explore the role of optix regulatory elements in wing color patterning using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to delete candidate optix cis-regulatory elements. I then investigate the conservation of the ancestral Optix eye network in the pigmentation pathway by deleting candidate downstream target genes of Optix and describe the resulting wing pattern mutations. This work provides foundational information on the role of this network in Heliconius wing color patterning and how it may have evolved.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:55Z (GMT).

This argument is framed within the observation that though recent scholarly efforts have argued against essentialist presentations of Hellenistic Jewish identities, these efforts tend to rely heavily upon textual evidence. Such a reliance is problematic because these sources relate the perspective of only a select, "elite" portion of Jewish society. This thesis uses a case study focused upon burial unguentaria from Jerusalem to assert that unguentaria may be used to counter this limitation. The vessels‚Äô capacity to amend this current situation rests in the very characteristic which has for so long kept them isolated from theoretical studies, namely their ubiquity throughout the material record.       The case study begins with a short descriptive overview, after which the significance of unguentaria within contemporary theories of inventive tradition and narrative identity formation is outlined. Upon discussing how unguentaria relate to ideas of non-essentialized identity construction, this thesis then contextualizes its theoretical application of unguentaria within current text-based scholarly trends, especially the here-termed "engaged model." The project concludes by reiterating that unguentaria should not be viewed as inconsequential materials but instead dynamic components of the archaeological record with the capacity to positively inform ongoing scholarly discussions.

In this dissertation I tackle the problem of Russian /v/ by situating it in a broader cross-linguistic landscape, in terms of its acoustic properties, its relationship to other non-sibilant voiced fricatives, or voiced spirants /Œ≤, √∞, …£/, and its phonological typology.  The empirical results of the dissertation challenge the binary division between obstruents and sonorants, and suggest that a finer distinction is required. Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 focus on the phonetic characteristics of /v/.  Chapter 2 investigates the relationship between voicing and frication type in four languages‚ÄîEnglish, Greek, Serbian, and Russian‚Äîusing measures that distinguish between voicing and frication type: duration, harmonicity, and spectral centroid.  Two environments, word-initial stressed and word-medial unstressed, are used in order to assess the effect of word-internal prosodic factors.  I argue based on these results that although /v/ has the highest harmonicity in each language, the relationship between voicing and frication type is revealed by spectral centroid, and that the relationship is independent in English and Greek, but not in Serbian; in Russian the results depend on environment.  Chapter 3 tests whether there exists a correlation between phonological and phonetic identity, using Greek, in which /v/ patterns as an obstruent, Serbian, in which /v/ patterns as a sonorant, and Russian, in which /v/ is ambiguous.  A partial correlation between phonetic and phonological identity was found, with the relativized centroid values for Greek and Serbian /v/ being distinguished in both environments.  Russian and Greek do not differ significantly in the WIS environment, while Russian and Serbian do not differ significantly in the WMU environment. Chapter 4 turns to investigating the distribution in consonant inventories and implicational relations of voicing in spirants and sibilants.  The results of this investigation show that voiced spirants and voiced sibilants do not share the same cross-linguistic distribution: voiced spirants frequently surface in small inventories, but only if unpaired, while the correlation between the presence of voiced sibilants (which only occur with a voiceless counterpart) and inventory size is linear.  Voiced spirants also tend to appear in inventories without a voicing contrast in the stops, unlike voiced sibilants. Chapter 5 argues that Russian /v/ is featurally specified as [+sonorant, +obstruent], and that regressive voicing assimilation is inherently asymmetric: all segments that are [+obstruent] are targets of devoicing under regressive voicing assimilation and final devoicing, but only segments that are exclusively obstruents trigger RVA.  A typology of phonological patterning of /v/ under [obstruent] and [sonorant] is proposed. Chapter 6 considers the quantal nature of [obstruent] and [sonorant], and sketches a model that combines Quantal Theory (Stevens, 1989) and Emergent Feature Theory (Mielke, 2008).  It is argued that by expanding the set of quantal domains, both clear cases of feature assignment and ambiguous cases can be understood within the same framework.

Dubreuil, Laurent||Mann, Jenny C	2018-10-22T18:45:57Z			8/30/18		The Mind Transfigur‚Äôd argues that the early modern period‚Äôs fascination with embodied experience primed authors to experiment with literature‚Äôs effects on their audiences. The rise of permanent theaters in London coupled with a broader interest in the philosophy of mind encouraged playwrights to attend to the dynamics of audiences‚Äô experiences. Accordingly, early modern plays, particularly those of William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe, reveal a pronounced degree of self-aware "metatheatricality" that predicts how an audience will respond to a dramatic work. Beyond simply reminding playgoers of a play‚Äôs fictional nature, this form of theatrical self-awareness folds an audience‚Äôs experience into the dramatic work itself, incorporating it into the play‚Äôs thematic concerns. This project suggests that we might understand Shakespeare and Marlowe as conducting experiments on their audiences, prodding and manipulating the minds of individuals in order to reveal hidden aspects of the audience‚Äôs selves. Extending beyond their historical moment, these experiments continue to work upon our minds today and offer us new forms of self-experience. To elucidate these experiments and explain their significance for audiences both modern and historical, this project analyzes early modern drama through the lens of three disparate archives: historical writing on the embodied mind, phenomenological philosophy, and findings from the cognitive sciences. This approach, known as neurophenomenology, aims to trace the complexities of aesthetic experience and offer scientific explanations for it, while also remaining attentive to way historical individuals described their experiences. In drawing connections between the minds of early modern individuals and our own, this project argues that the embodied self is a product of evolutionary forces as well as social and cultural ones, and this allows us to appreciate what parts of our selves we share with historical individuals. Each chapter focuses on one aspect of embodied selfhood and examines how Shakespeare and Marlowe‚Äôs plays manipulate our self-experience. Analyzing famously self-aware plays such as Edward II, Richard II, Doctor Faustus and Hamlet, the chapters of The Mind Transfigur‚Äôd demonstrate how early modern drama reveals parts of our minds that might otherwise remain hidden,  performing a kind of cognitive science before its time.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:57Z (GMT).

The first three chapters lay out the intuition for understanding the later experimental results and the required experimental considerations to generate data with robust interpretations. The second half discusses the measure of current-induced spin-orbit torques in four rare earth metals (Gd, Dy, Ho, and Lu) and the way in which the presence (or absence) of $4f$ orbital derived states at the Fermi level influences the torques generated. The final chapter discuses the non-trivial temperature evolution of the torques generated by a Kondo lattice system, YbAl$_3$, in light of the understanding gained from the study of the pure rare earth materials. Ultimately, it is argued that the measurement of current-induced spin-orbit torques may be a useful analytical tool for probing the Fermi surface of $f$-valent and heavy fermion systems.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:58Z (GMT).

The first deals with bike-sharing systems which are now ubiquitous across the U.S.A. We have worked with Motivate, the operator of the systems in, for example, New York City, Chicago, and San Francisco, to innovate a data-driven approach to managing both their day-to-day operations and to provide insight on several central issues in the design of their systems. This work required the development of a number of new optimization models, characterizing their mathematical structure, and using this insight in designing algorithms to solve them. Many of these projects have been fully implemented to improve the design, rebalancing, and maintenance of Motivate‚Äôs systems across the country. In the second part, we study a queueing-theoretic model of on-demand transportation systems (e.g., Uber/Lyft, Scoot, etc.) to derive approximately optimal pricing, dispatch, and rebalancing policies. Though the resulting problems are high-dimensional and non-convex, we develop a general approximation framework, based on a novel convex relaxation. Our approach provides efficient algorithms with rigorous approximation guarantees for a wide range of objectives and controls.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:45:59Z (GMT).

While much is known about the role of selection in sorting variation, relatively less is known about how phenotypic variation is produced. In this thesis I investigate the genetic and developmental sources of craniofacial phenotype in a radiation of three ecologically diverse species of pupfishes (genus Cyprinodon) endemic to San Salvador Island, Bahamas. Species differ primarily in oral jaw morphology, and phenotypic differences arise during post-hatching growth resulting from modifications to the relative growth rates of oral jaw bones (Chapter 1). I provide an embryonic staging series for Cyprinodon (Chapter 2), and use RNA-seq to screen for genes differentially expressed between species at 4 developmental stages (Chapter 3). Fully understanding how modifications at the level of gene expression (Chapter 3) may influence modifications to growth rates at an organismal level (Chapter 2) requires study of the processes operating at the cellular and tissue levels of biological organization. Patterns of cell proliferation differ between species of pupfishes and may be a way that genetic changes have phenotypic consequences on craniofacial morphology (Chapter 4). Taken together, these studies show how understanding the evolution of phenotypic diversity requires investigating the generative processes responsible for producing phenotypic variation at multiple levels of biological organization.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:02Z (GMT).

In this regime, significant advantages have been shown in applications of ultra-shallow junction formation in ion-implanted III‚ÄìV and III‚ÄìN semiconductor materials. Dopant activation of Si-doped InGaAs and GaN heterostructure was studied using CO2 and laser diode annealing in sub-millisecond and millisecond timescale. Under LSA, the activation of high‚Äìdose implanted dopants was increased in both InGaAs and GaN to peak concentrations comparable (>80%) to the as-implanted dose. During laser annealing, thermodynamic limits were also approached including materials decomposition and damage, which ultimately limited full characterization of the activation behaviors. To better understand the annealing windows, we developed an in‚Äìsitu characterization technique which matches well with laser annealing for combinatorial and high‚Äìthroughput characterization; this capability significantly enhances the characterization kinetic dopant activation limitations of III‚ÄìV and III‚ÄìN materials.  A complementary approach for temperature profiling of LSA was also developed using a thermoreflectance imaging technique. The temperature dependence of reflectance at short wavelengths was used to determine the in-situ dynamic temperatures during CO2 LSA. Temperatures were calibrated using optical functions of bulk Si with effects of black-body radiation emission captured at longer wavelengths. Thermoreflectance imaging results were compared with previous results, and show good agreements with direct Pt thermistor measurements and simulations results in both space and time. In the future, thermoreflectance imaging can be exploited to understand not only impurity interaction in III‚ÄìV and III‚ÄìN materials, but also to explore kinetics and phase transformations in metastable materials.

Graphene, as a single layer of carbon atoms with a unique band structure, and monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>), a three-atom-thick semiconductor, have been of particular interest both for the physics accessible in 2D crystals and the applications achievable with highly flexible materials. This dissertation presents a variety of experiments exploring the optoelectronic and mechanical properties of both monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> and graphene. In particular, we present three studies: (1) the experimental realization of the valley Hall effect, an effect based on the Berry curvature of a material‚Äôs energy bands, in monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub>; (2) methods for directly measuring the bending stiffness of graphene (and related 2D materials); and (3) an investigation of the wrapping of micro-spherical droplets by monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub>. We conclude by discussing the future outlook of both "valleytronics" and microencapsulation by 2D materials.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:03Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Understanding the railroads as a cultural as well as a material phenomenon, this work approaches the western Anatolian railways through a series of interdisciplinary vignettes that juxtapose the histories of the built environment with histories of technology, archaeology, travel, and the senses.  In an effort to modernize its transportation infrastructure, the Ottoman government granted the first railway concessions in Anatolia to two British companies. The Izmir-Aydƒ±n and Izmir-Kasaba lines connected the port city of Izmir to the fertile river valleys of the Gediz, K√º√ß√ºk and B√ºy√ºk Menderes rivers. The construction of railways was an intensely material act, requiring not only the laying of tracks and the construction of station buildings, but the alteration of a whole landscape. Beyond this physicality, the railroads were harbingers of new modes of interaction with space. They altered the commercial transportation networks of the region that had depended for centuries on camel caravans traveling along well-established but flexible pathways. People also found a new mobility in the train. In addition to the thousands of local inhabitants of the region, masses of tourists arrived to partake in the ready access to some of the best known ancient and Biblical places of archaeological significance. The railways incited new archaeological explorations that expanded knowledge, and facilitated the acquisition of antiquities for museums, private collections and even as construction materials. Additionally, railroads brought with them novel sensory perceptions. From the moment when the first locomotive whistle was heard in Izmir to the illumination of the night with a thousand flickering lights in the celebration of Sultan Abdulaziz's visit to the city and its railway, a new and industrial sensorium was woven onto the existing sensory geography of the region. Thus, through such explorations, this dissertation foregrounds how the experiences of space were altered with the advent of railways in western Anatolia.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:04Z (GMT).

Therefore, this study examined the nitrogen (N) cycling dynamics, water quality treatment, and greenhouse gas emissions from stormwater basins located on Cornell University‚Äôs campus. Stormwater basins that were often saturated ("Wet Basins") had a greater abundance of denitrification genes, and denitrified a greater proportion of incoming N. However, overall N treatment (measured as the difference between incoming N and N leaving the basin underdrains) was greater in quick draining "Dry Basins" likely due to the large volume of infiltrated stormwater. Rain events did not create hot-moment emissions of N2O or CH4 from these basins. Using EPA calculations, stormwater sent to a WWTP would produce 7X more CO2-eq per L than if it were sent to a Dry Basin. Conversely, stormwater sent to a Wet Basin instead of the WWTP would lead to an approximately 8X increase in CO2. These results suggest that stormwater basins with saturated conditions are likely doing a better job of completely removing N via denitrification, but are also emitting greater quantities of GHGs. Thus, the tradeoff between better N water quality treatment and greater GHG emissions must be considered when designing stormwater basins. In an effort to understand how increased urbanization will influence the soil microbial community, we examined the soil microbiome in stormwater basins after 2-months and 2-years of exposure. Overall, the microbial communities did not shift dramatically within the stormwater sites. Microbial sub-pathways of methanogenesis and V-ATPase were increased within the Wet Basin treatment, likely due to excess Na and soil moisture. While denitrification is also an anaerobic process like methanogenesis, the denitrification genes did not increase within the often saturated Wet Basin treatment. This indicates that denitrification may take longer than 2-years to adjust to new environments, and practices like stormwater basins that rely on denitrification to remove nitrogen and improve water quality may be initially limited. In addition to these field studies, a lab-scale mesocolumn study done in collaboration with Monash University examined the plant-microbe interactions and their impact on N treatment within stormwater basins. We conducted N water quality, N partitioning, soil metagenomics and 16S profiling across 7 unique plant species and 1 soil control over the 2-year experiment. Plant species with greater root volume, plant and microbial assimilation, and NOx removal, had lower denitrification genes and rates. Our hypothesis that greater denitrification would lead to better NOx removal was not supported by these data, because plant species with high NOx removal depressed denitrification genes and rates, but led to a better ‚Äòtreatment‚Äô rate as a larger proportion of incoming N was assimilated and did not directly exit the column drainage. This aligns with the other projects where increased denitrification did not necessarily lead to higher N treatment, unless the ultimate fate of N is considered, and then the amount denitrified is more critical. Overall, anaerobic conditions in stormwater basins promoted denitrification and complete removal of N from downstream waters. However, because of excess greenhouse gas emissions, designers should consider the tradeoffs when installing these stormwater treatment technologies.

These batteries have not been commercialized due to the challenges caused by their complex electrochemical reactions such as the shuttle effect and solubility of higher order Polysulfides in the electrolytes. In this thesis, we discuss attempts to combat these technical issues by combining physical and chemical modifications of mesoporous carbon nanofibers as electrodes or interlayers, by incorporation of cyclic Nitrogen groups,  using Gas-Assisted electrospinning and electrospraying techniques.  We also compare the synergistic effects off all these features on  battery performance and use various characterization tools to understand them.

It contributes novel theoretical and empirical insights using a combination of social network analysis on originally collected surveys of farmers in Ghana and Malawi. Each chapter highlights the nuanced and unique contributions of social networks within village economies, including the ways they influence decision-making through social learning processes and local norms of redistribution. Chapters two and three suggest that variation in bonds of friendship influence the quality of information one receives and the extent to which redistributive giving leads to efficient outcomes. Chapter four explores a common policy framework utilized by governments and NGOs to engage with communities as comprehensive units of society. It finds that variation in capacity for local collective action is not adequately harnessed when NGOs and governments deal with communities in a homogeneous manner. As a whole, this dissertation invites a new path of inquiry that takes seriously the varying degrees to which communities possess the capacity to influence economic development. The nuanced understandings of community economies invites future research to consider means of integrating community functions into development policies that have historically depended on broadening access to mutually beneficial exchange through markets.

These capsids mediate many of the processes required for infection and are remarkably stable. However, antibody binding or mutations to the capsid can disrupt these processes and block infection. This dissertation discusses mutations to the canine parvovirus (CPV) capsid that result in loss of infection, the interaction between CPV and the transferrin receptor (TfR), and parvovirus endogenous viral elements (EVEs), which contain ancient parvovirus gene sequences. 	I found that point mutations to CPV VP2 residues 270, 272, 273, and 299/300 result in loss of viral infectivity. Mutation of residue 270 results in loss of a sub-molar proteolytic cleavage event in VP2 and increases capsid stability, residue 272 mutation causes loss of capsid assembly, and residue 273 mutation results in assembled capsids being trapped in the nucleus. Mutation of VP2 residues 299 and 300, which are associated with TfR binding, to lysine disrupts the interaction between CPV and the TfR, inhibiting infection but still allowing receptor binding and uptake into cells.  	I also found that CPV has different interactions with TfRs from different host species, binding strongly to some TfRs and very weakly to others, even though each TfR can mediate a successful infection. TfRs from different species also had varying levels of occupancy on CPV capsids, with up to 12 black-backed jackal TfRs, but only 1-2 feline TfRs binding to each capsid, and it is possible that the feline TfR induces a conformational change in CPV that inhibits binding of additional TfRs. Antibody binding could also disrupt the CPV/TfR binding interaction, suggesting a possible mechanism of virus neutralization. 	To examine the structure and function of ancient parvovirus capsids, I expressed the VP2 gene from three different parvovirus EVEs. VP2 expressed from an EVE in the M. spretus genome assembled into capsids, and I determined that these capsids were highly stable, could bind to N-Acetylneuraminic acid, and were endocytosed into murine cells.  	The results in this dissertation provide new information about parvovirus infection, receptor binding interactions, and evolution, and further the understanding of how infection occurs and may be disrupted."		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:06Z (GMT).

This eDNA is ubiquitous in soils, where it arises from either cell lysis or DNA secretion, and where it may persist for many years. Interest in the issue of soil eDNA has recently been piqued in the fields of molecular biology and microbial ecology because eDNA has the potential to bias sequence-based estimates of microbial community composition, inflate measures of alpha and beta diversity, and interfere with the detection of community shifts over time.  In the first chapter, we examine the impacts of soil moisture, soil temperature, agricultural management, and habitat type on the degradation/persistence dynamics of eDNA in soil microcosms, using a synthetic eDNA marker which was traceable with both sequence-specific qPCR and 16S rRNA community sequencing. We found that despite very rapid degradation within the first week, a small fraction (< 1%) of the eDNA standard remained detectable with qPCR throughout the experiments (39 - 77 days). This suggests that eDNA may be indefinitely stabilized within soil. We also found that degradation/stabilization dynamics differed across gradients of environmental conditions and soil characteristics, with initial degradation rate (within the first week) being positively correlated with soil moisture, temperature, and tillage intensity, but negatively correlated with soil organic matter content. Longer-term stabilization (> 39 days) of the eDNA standard was highest at low moisture, low temperature, and low tillage intensity, but was not significantly correlated with soil organic matter. Additionally, among agricultural, forest, and meadow soils we found that forest soils had the slowest initial degradation rate, and meadow soils had the most stabilization of the eDNA standard. The eDNA standard was detectable by qPCR at all time-points for all treatments, but within the first week became only inconsistently detectable with high-throughput sequencing, the eDNA standard having dropped below the limit of detection for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The time to disappearance below the sequencing limit of detection was calculated as ranging from 0.9 - 19.4 days, depending on treatment conditions. Therefore, we conclude that the ability of stabilized soil eDNA to bias estimates of microbial community structure depends on the sensitivity of the detection method and the objectives of the experiment. In the second chapter, we place the first chapter into a wider context by reviewing the impacts of eDNA on estimates of microbial communities in soils, and discussing evidence that eDNA-driven bias is or is not a problem in community structure estimates. We discuss the factors that influence the degradation/stabilization dynamics of eDNA in soils, techniques to reduce eDNA-driven bias, potential opportunities to exploit eDNA as a powerful tool for microbial community characterization, and important directions for future eDNA-related research. Taken together, this work constitutes a contribution of new knowledge and insight to the field of soil microbial ecology. This research and analysis will improve the ability of researchers to accurately characterize microbial communities using culture-independent methods, while understanding the extent to which eDNA may introduce bias to those estimates.

An aggregation of heat pumps can provide an alternate source of frequency regulation by generating flexibility on the demand side as opposed to inefficient natural gas generators that are a source of supply side flexibility. This in turn can facilitate greater incorporation of power generated from clean but intermittent sources of energy such as wind and solar. To this end, a hierarchical control scheme is introduced that will enable an aggregator to tap into the inherent flexibility associated with a portfolio of variable speed heat pump/thermal storage subsystems. This work concentrates on the development of a model based predictive controller operating on the subsystem level and its integration into the global control architecture. Additionally, the value of formulating the performance cost optimization function and the system dynamics equation as a mixed integer program is explored. The aforementioned formulation facilitates the use of simplified, yet comprehensive, dynamic heat pump performance models and at the same time addresses the problem of heat pump operation in the compressor dead-band range. The simulations also highlight the power-tracking functionality of the developed controller when it is integrated with higher level controllers in the hierarchical control scheme.

Virginia, the Supreme Court held that the execution of individuals with intellectual disability violated the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  When creating the categorical exemption in Atkins the Court recognized that without the exemption juries might consider intellectual disability to be a two-edged sword: "it may diminish his blameworthiness for his crime even as it indicates that there is a probability that he will be dangerous in the future."  The Supreme Court also held that the Eight Amendment limits the extent that states can impose the most serious punishments on juveniles, including certain forms of life without parole.  This dissertation examines whether the two-edged nature of intellectual disability or young age may influence other decisions in the justice system that ultimately affect criminal sentences. The first Chapter examines whether parole board decisions in South Carolina cause some juvenile offenders to serve de facto life without parole sentences. Chapter Two explores whether mental health experts may be influenced by the facts of a heinous crime or their beliefs about the death penalty when they diagnose intellectual disability in death penalty cases. Chapter Three examines the post-conviction relief process for people appealing their death sentences because they are categorically exempt from the death penalty. It argues that the more-forgiving procedural exemptions applied in claims of innocence should be applied in claims of ineligibility for the death penalty.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:07Z (GMT).

These institutions agree on the need to create a singular national curriculum and increase governmental regulation of Islamic schools. The rationales for the necessity of this education reform vary from an emphasis on government support for private schools to an assumption that Islamic extremism emerges because of a deleterious Islamic education and misteachings of the Quran. This effort to reform Islamic schools by standardizing the curriculum and increasing government regulation of the education system is based on the assumptions that standardization is possible and Islamic practices and beliefs in Burkina Faso are narrowly divided by fundamental extremists against liberal moderates. In this paper, I seek to challenge these assumptions by offering a history of the Communaut√© Musulmane de Haute Volta. In 1962, the Communaut√© became the Upper Volta‚Äôs first formal Islamic organization. On the occasion of the first General Assembly, the Communaut√©‚Äôs leaders declared that Muslims within the newly independent nation were united. However, over the succeeding decade, disputes within the organization over religious teachings and practices revealed a divergence of views on the ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô forms of Islam despite a shared political interest in safeguarding Islam from the secular state. The Communaut√©'s efforts failed because of their struggles to codify Islam in creating a national curriculum. I use this case to argue for caution on the part of those who would seek to promote a national Franco-Arab education as a forum through which to deliver religious teachings. I suggest that this rational-technocratic project might learn from the long history of the plural and dynamic nature of Islam in Burkina Faso and the fate of the Communaut√©.

Imaging whole cells with cryo-TEM, however, requires consideration of the cell‚Äôs thickness: some cells are naturally electron transparent, while others are too thick for analysis with the TEM. High-resolution imaging, therefore, relies not only on selecting the appropriate microscopy technique, but also on the inherent dimensions of the cell under examination. This dissertation presents three reports of three cell types with different dimensions. The first report explores the post-insemination phenomenological changes to the spermatozoa of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Because spermatozoa are naturally electron semi-transparent, we utilized cryo-energy-filtered TEM to produce high-resolution information documenting the removal of the sperm coat and outer membrane. We then describe a correlation between modifications in sperm ultrastructure and motility, and enhanced fecundity in female Aedes aegypti.  The second report explores the formation of extracellular vesicles in MCF10A and hyaluronic acid synthase 3 (HAS3)-overexpressed MCF10A cells. Both cell lines are electron-opaque, and their morphologies were examined using florescence, conventional, and cryo-scanning electron microscopies. Using different microscopies elucidated the strengths and limitations of each technique, and how they could be combined to best characterize the effects of HAS3 overexpression on transformed MCF10A cells. Secreted extracellular vesicles were electron-transparent and their surface structures were examined with cryo-TEM. Microvesicles contained surface structure and exosomes did not, providing a pathway for differentiating between vesicle subpopulations in the future. The third report characterizes the chromatophores of photosynthetic bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Because whole R. sphaeroides are too thick to analyze with cryo-TEM, we thinned the cell with cryo-focused ion beam milling. Additionally, we used cryo-electron tomography to understand the 3D arrangement of chromatophores within the cell. We determined that chromatophores adopt both isolated and connected morphologies. Connected chromatophores exist as either budded structures, or linked to neighboring chromatophores through ~10 nm long extrinsic linkers.  Cryo-TEM provides ultrastructural information of cells and cellular components. However, the exact approach depends on the dimensions of the cell and the feature of interest. When carefully chosen, the techniques described in this dissertation provide invaluable insight into cell structure.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:08Z (GMT).

Ride-sharing services provided by companies like Uber or Lyft make it easier for those who are unable to operate a personal vehicle in big cities like NYC to find a ride with a lower price. This study demonstrates the advantages of the ride sharing service compared to the ordinary non-shared ride service based on the simulation model of both systems. This study also illustrates a method to optimize the ride sharing systems by utilizing an individualist pricing strategy.  An optimal discount foreach ride sharing request to maximize the total expected profit of the system can be found based on the decision tree model and discrete choice model implemented in this study. The purpose of the decision tree model is to determine whether a ride-sharing request can be shared with others in the system while the discrete choice model is used to estimate the passenger‚Äôs willingness to accept a certain price for the ride-sharing service. These two factors are of vital importance when calculating the expected profit of serving a request.The individual pricing strategy makes the price of the ride-sharing service more rational according to the features of the requests and thus can be an efficient way to attract more potential customers.

Plant-absorbed minerals form the source of 22 elements required by the human body for proper functionality, whether eaten directly or through meat consumption. The proportion of a plant or other organism that forms the inorganic mineral and trace elements is defined as the ionome. Study of the ionome has the potential to affect a wide range of agronomically pertinent areas affecting agriculture and society, including nutrient-use efficiency, toxicology, bio-fortification, bio-availability, bio-remediation and mitigation of toxic metals in the crops we consume. Maize is a model species, well suited to ionomic studies because of the high diversity in genic regions, but is also the most widely grown staple food crop on the planet with significant cultivation on every continent except Antarctica. Maize also provides a diverse collection of germplasm with the feasibility of creating segregating progenies and immortal genotypes through self-fertilization. This dissertation investigates the dynamic nature of field-based maize kernel concentrations of 20 elements in order to simulate ‚Äòreal-world‚Äô situations experienced by plants grown as food, but also to reflect a plant‚Äôs necessarily complex genetic adaptation to environments. This study utilized both linkage and association mapping on multiple populations, benefiting from advantageous population design and genetic architecture. Analysis across different populations discovered significant genomic regions that co-localized with known and novel candidate genes. For all 20 elements, significant regions were most frequently found in single field locations, ranging between 219 and 7240 regions per element across locations collectively. Nevertheless, some of these regions were discovered in two or more field environments. The occurrence of significant regions found in two or more locations ranged between 19 and 25. Two additional populations provided nearly isogenic backgrounds to investigate regions found to be significant in previous studies. Specifically, these populations provide evidence for the discovery of a cadmium regulator explaining about 23mg/kg difference between haplotypes, localized to a region of chromosome 2. The results from these studies are anticipated to contribute to the understanding of gene action across environments and provide a rich resource for the identification of genes driving elemental accumulation in maize grain, which can be used to create new varieties better suited to feed our changing world.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:09Z (GMT).

In this work, we show that for any finite flat reduced complete intersection over $W(\mathbf{k})$, $\mathcal{R}$, we can construct a deformation problem defined by local conditions imposed on some finite set of places in $F$, such that the corresponding universal deformation ring of $\bar{\rho}$ is $\mathcal{R}$. It's a theorem of Wiles that if the local conditions are chosen to express restriction to deformations coming from modular forms, then the corresponding universal deformation ring is a finite flat reduced complete intersection, so our work can be regarded as a converse to Wiles' result.

By thinking of network configuration in terms of paths (instead of individual devices), network administrators can reap significant benefits in terms of usability, performance and correctness. Paths themselves can be specified and reasoned about using foundational computational tools such as regular expressions and Kleene Algebras. Furthermore, path-based abstractions can express key network behavior such as isolation requirements and bandwidth constraints, while supporting heterogeneity in terms of devices, physical substrates and administrative domains. This dissertation shows that it is possible to use specifications of network paths, extended with constraints on traffic classes, bandwidth, and the capabilities of network devices, to enable flexible management of modern networks. This is realized by developing path-oriented domain-specific languages to express network policies. These languages show that by starting with abstractions for network paths, it is possible to specify route and bandwidth requirements for classes of traffic, delegate policy management to trusted parties, and enable high-level management of heterogenous networks. Furthermore, by leveraging techniques and tools such as mixed-integer programming, SAT solvers and SDN controller frameworks, we have built practical compilers and runtimes for these languages. These compilers take high-level specifications of network policies and generate efficient configurations for a range of network devices including packet and optical switches, middlebox frameworks and end-hosts. We have tested these implementations by building and benchmarking a range of practical applications on real-world networks.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:10Z (GMT).

Several tunable parameters like particle shape, inter-particle interactions and geometry of the assembly, allow the design of a wide range of morphologies and material properties. In this work, Monte Carlo simulations are used to study the entropy-driven assembly of space-filling convex prism shapes; namely, square and hexagonal prisms under parallel slit-confinement, with either hard or soft-repulsive wall potentials. Phases with diverse structural order arise due to the anisotropy associated with the prismatic particle shape and the restriction of the entropic degrees of freedom of these particles by the wall potentials. In the hard-wall slit-confinement model, the wall separation were varied to explore the 2D and quasi-2D phase behavior of square and hexagonal prisms. Our simulation results for hexagonal prisms revealed two types of first order phase transitions at the quasi-2D confinement separations: 1) solid-solid transition (6-fold symmetry solid to 4-fold symmetry solid) occurring through lattice symmetry breaking, and 2) solid-dense liquid-solid (6-fold symmetry solid-no order-4-fold symmetry solid). The predicted dense liquid has a density intermediate between those of the two solid phases and has high translational/orientational disorder and mobility. For square prisms, we observe a solid-polycrystalline-solid phase transition where a lattice spacing rearrangement gives rise to the polycrystalline phase having multiple locally ordered domains. The unusual phase transitions predicted in this work for the hard confinement model are attributed to the broken ergodicity associated with a dynamically disconnected rotational phase space accessible to the particles. Indeed, for a narrow range of slit separations, particles have two distinct and dynamically disconnected rotational states: unflipped (with prism face parallel to wall plane) and flipped (with prism side parallel to wall plane), which cast distinct projection areas over the wall plane and lead to different 2D tessellating lattices. As an experimentally viable strategy to dynamically bridge those rotational states but still retain the observed hard-slit phase behavior, a soft-repulsive wall model was also investigated.

The concept was rooted in the influence of virtual simulations on human cognition, in which the brain has not yet evolved to differentiate mediated experiences from real ones. The particular simulation (7 Days to Die) in question was set in a world with a fully destructible environment.  Players allocated cognitive resources to avoid hunger, dehydration, and rise/drop in internal core temperature, which are vital health measures. Threats to survival presented themselves in the form of food scarcity, hypothermia, and even gravity. I hypothesized that this simulation would provide an engaging experience that, upon reflection, will shift attitudes, feelings, and intentions towards current real-world threats to environmental sustainability, specifically energy conservation. The common person should know where the energy that supports their livelihood is generated, and also be mindful of what resources are irreversibly consumed in the process. However, this importance does not guarantee that the common person will participate in energy consumption behaviors in the best possible way, especially when inconvenient. That is, the immediate benefits are more important than the costs in the uncertain future. This uncertainty is the root of plausible deniability of decision-making that results in environmentally unfavorable energy consumption behaviors. In this study, participants were provided examples of certainty via this simulation, where the support structures responsible for providing convenient means of survival are no longer available. This was meant to bring perspective into peoples‚Äô lives by eliciting a real-time emotional response to the disturbing and frightening causal conclusions of environmentally damaging behavior, such as failure to comply with energy conservation behaviors at the individual level.

However, only recently have the dynamics of this interplay been brought to the forefront of the scientific community‚Äôs focus. The surprising finding of this effort, as it pertains to cancer, has been that cell-matrix interactions appear to be at least as critical to understanding the genesis and progression of the disease as are genetics or DNA mutation. The most immediately studied mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix include: the density of the matrix, alignment of the matrix fibers, stiffness of the fibers, and the tension on the fibers. The methods developed for controlling these variables have been numerous, however, few have succeeded in the deconvolution of the set. Here, novel experimentation, device construction, and theoretical treatments aimed to achieve this purpose are presented. The aggregate results of this dissertation argue that while these properties, which have historically been treated as separate mechanical cues in which a cancer cell must contend during invasion, are better interpreted through the single physical lens of energy expenditure. The conclusion is that cancer cells preferentially invade via the energy minimizing path and as such, can be at least partially inhibited by targeting the cells‚Äô external environment rather than exclusively its internal workings as has been the historical approach.

Understanding the relationship between a material's properties and its crystal structure allows materials with specific properties to be designed by modifying or controlling the crystal structure. Many materials have been designed using chemical intuition which is continually improved as more and more materials are made. This process relies on new materials being synthesized and characterized, which often requires significant time and effort. Density functional theory was developed more than half a century ago and provides a way to simulate the electronic structure, and therefore numerous properties of a crystal structure. Combined with ever improving computational abilities, in many cases it has become easier to study materials by simulating their properties than synthesizing them. While these simulations do not perfectly replicate the properties of a real material, the predictions of simulations are often reliable enough to serve as a guide for where to focus experimental efforts. Simulations provide a straightforward way to study crystals that may not be possible to synthesize experimentally because the crystal structure is completely controlled during a simulation, whereas the laws of physics control an actual crystal structure. This precise control over the crystal structure allows the relationship between crystal structure and a material's properties to be easily and directly probed. Once this relationship is understood, efforts can be made to force a material to form in a crystal structure with desirable properties.  This dissertation presents several computational studies, primarily using density functional theory, of crystal structures and their relationship to macroscopic properties. La2SrCr2O7 was studied to explain why it forms in a never before seen crystal structure. A coupling between A-site disorder, B-site chemistry, and octahedral rotations was found and provides a route towards controlling the crystal structure in related materials. Antiferroelectricity was studied in PbZrO3 and found to be dependent on a flat energy landscape encompassing nonpolar and polar structures. Ideas for future work to improve the understanding of antiferroelectricity and possibly designing new antiferroelectrics are discussed. Finally, the crystal structure of Ln2NiO4+delta was studied, paying particular attention to the arrangement of excess oxygen atoms. These arrangements have a significant effect on the properties of Ln2NiO4+delta and should be considered in future computational studies.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:12Z (GMT).

The current study examined the correlation between these two psychology terms that have existed in isolation; a sense of purpose (purpose exploration and/or purpose commitment) and a belief in free will. It employed statistical correlation methods, and used the Revised Youth Purpose Survey (Bundick et al., 2006), and the Free Will and Determinism Scale (FAD) (Paulhus & Margesson, 1994) scales. The sample of students (N=364; 73.47% female, 26.53% males) ranged in age from 18-31, and were from a Predominately White institution in the Northeast. Results suggested that there is a correlation between purpose commitment and a belief in free will. This will be used as a preliminary study to further explore what possible mechanisms could alter that relationship between the constructs.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:13Z (GMT).

These residues cab be considerably rich in nitrogen (N) and their thermal transformation through pyrolysis can serve as a mechanisms of N retention in terrestrial ecosystems. This study focused on three main areas of the process transformation and stabilization of plant residue organic N; (1) the availability of plant residues for the production of PyOM; (2) the operating conditions of pyrolysis cookstoves which affect the production of C and N pollutants and heat transfer for cooking and (3) the thermal and biological transformation of organic N from plant residues.  In a plant residue resource availability analysis, a segmentation protocol was developed to evaluate the multiresolution segmentation (MRS) quality of an agricultural high resolution image. High quality image segmentation is essential for subsequent classification and quantification of plant residue availability. The main segmentation error occurred when an image object was missing in the segmentation layer. Missing objects can result in considerable over or underestimation of plant residues availability, depending on the final land cover classification.  The subsequent thermal conversion of plant residues was performed in an indirect pyrolysis cookstove. The rate of pyrolysis fuel consumption was the main driver of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions and heat output of the stove accounting for up to 70% of the variation in multivariate linear regression analysis. Meaning that the speed of cooking and the choice of fuel used, significantly affected the production of gaseous pollution while the amount of fuel used controlled the amount of heat produced for cooking.  Finally, the thermal transformation of organic matter nitrogen (OM-N) into PyOM-N was characterized using N near edge X-ray absorption fine structure. Our study revealed that the formation of aromatic N heterocycles was significantly correlated (R2=0.44; p<0.0001) with the initial N content in uncharred OM. In an incubation study, PyOM-C mineralization was inhibited by aromatic N heterocycles found in extracted PyOM, while aromatic N heterocycles in oxygenated rings found in the PyOM extract promoted PyOM-C mineralization. These findings support that PyOM-C mineralization is affected by the molecular structure of N rather than N content or C:N ratio.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:14Z (GMT).

These methods detect the captured serum antibodies by using secondary reagents that present certain limitations such as non-specific binding leading to false positives, species-specificity, time-intensive incubation steps and increased cost.  We report a novel biosensor based on the antibody-catalyzed water oxidation pathway (ACWOP), that directly detects captured antibodies by using their intrinsic catalytic property and generates an antibody-dependent colorimetric signal. The sensor uses inexpensive porous silica microparticles functionalized with an antigen and other ACWOP cofactors to capture specific antibodies on a surface and detect them via the ACWOP.  By eliminating secondary reagents, our sensor acts as a species-independent and inexpensive platform that aids in transitioning to our ultimate goal of developing a point-of-care device for widespread monitoring of Lyme disease across multiple hosts.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:14Z (GMT).

Current treatments focus on pain relief and mitigating symptoms rather than addressing the underlying source of pain, which in the majority of cases stems from radiculopathy. Strategies from tissue engineering have been introduced for the past 20 years to create biological treatments that can replace the pathologic tissue with a biomimetic implant that possesses regenerative potential. The current state of the field of IVD tissue engineering includes strategies for repair and replacement of individual components of the disc, the nucleus pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosus (AF), but only a handful of technologies for total disc replacement (TDR) have shown promise for clinical translation in vitro and in vivo.  	Total disc replacement with biological tissue-engineered IVDs (TE-IVDs) has only been tested in small animal models to date. This dissertation sought to address the need for a larger animal model that is clinically relevant to humans by demonstrating the feasibility of the canine cervical spine as a pre-clinical model of TDR with TE-IVDs. In this work, the focus was to investigate the appropriate implantation conditions for TDR in the cervical spine and the ability of TE-IVDs to integrate host tissue, mature, and restore function in vivo (Chapter 2). TE-IVDs for the canine cervical spine were developed as composite structures made of cell-seeded alginate NP surrounded by circumferentially aligned cell-seeded collagen AF. This in vivo study was the first to demonstrate that stably implanted TE-IVDs produced integrated tissues that resemble native IVD structure with viable cells in a canine pre-clinical model of TDR. 	Despite the favorable outcomes in stably implanted TE-IVDs, new challenges were identified in the canine model that had not been encountered in rodents before. Segment instability caused 50% of TE-IVDs to displace out of the disc space upon implantation and scaled-up TE-IVDs had yet to match native-like properties pre-operatively. The instability issue was addressed (chapter 3) by investigating a combined treatment approach of TE-IVD implantation with a resorbable plating system proposed to assist in transferring compressive loads of motion segments along the vertebral bodies and retain TE-IVD implants in the disc space. To improve potential functionality of TE-IVDs, the study described in chapter 4 leverages the tunable AF region of the TE-IVDs to investigate the potential of high-density collagen as AF scaffolds and assess the effects of initial scaffold concentration and cell seeding density with hMSCs on the remodeling of the resultant composite TE-IVD structure. Collectively, these studies offered promising alternatives to promote the success of TDR in a pre-clinical animal model with TE-IVDs."			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:14Z (GMT).

Effect of eight pre-treatment combinations was evaluated on calibration performance and standard normal variate and de-trend (SNVD), with the first derivative calculated on two data points and no smoothing (SNVD+1111), was adequate to build a robust model. Generally, high calibration performance was obtained for most traits e.g. model for DMC on mashed samples had - R2c = 99%, R2cv = 95%, RPD = 4.5 and SECV = 0.9, with satisfactory R2 of 80% on independent validation set. On average, models developed with mashed were better than the intact samples. Intact and mashed NIRS-derived DMC were highly correlated (0.94) and had higher correlations (>0.95) with the ideal oven-drying than the specific gravity methods (0.49 and 0.69, depending on the dataset). Non-linear calibration model using random forest (RF), was equally develop and used to process spectra from National Root Crops Research Institute (NRCRI), Umudike for carotenoids including total carotenoid content (TCC) and some individual carotenoids (ICS): all-trans Œ≤-carotene (ATBC), violaxanthin (VIO), Lutein (LUT), 15-Cis beta-carotene (15CBC), 13-Cis beta-carotene (13CBC), Alpha-carotene (AC), 9-Cis beta-carotene (9CBC) and phytoene (PHY) .  Derived carotenoids were used to understand correlations (phenotypic and genotypic), especially between TCC and ICS. High and positive phenotypic and genotypic correlations (>0.75) were obtained between TCC and the ICS except for PHY and LUT. Genome-wide association studies identified previously reported region on chromosome 1 associated with variation in TCC, in addition to other unidentified associations for both TCC and the ICS. Evaluating the potential of using Genome-wide predictions for carotenoids improvement, higher predictions were obtained from non-linear RF model with a one-step approach in single and multi-trait scenarios than linear and two-step approaches. The possibility of using molecular markers to assign parentage to progenies from a polycross nursery scheme was demonstrated with 100% assignment accuracy from simulated datasets. The information provided in this study is vital in redefining cassava breeding.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:15Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The mechanisms of activation of the innate immunity signaling pathways that cause asthma are not fully understood yet. This study investigated the novel targets for the development of new asthma therapeutics. Innate immunity provides the first line of defense against bacterial and viral pathogens. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) act as sentinels to detect specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). TLR-initiated signaling cascades trigger inflammatory, allergic and non-allergic responses via NF-kappaB signaling. Loss of proper innate immunity regulation leads to inflammatory diseases such as asthma. IRAK-M is a known negative regulator of TLR signaling and is known to assemble into the activated TLR signaling complex to attenuate downstream signaling. Prolyl peptide bonds, such as in the phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro (pS/T-P) motifs recognized by Pin1, can exist in two distinct isomer conformations, cis and trans, that exchange on a slow time scale (exchange time constant of several minutes). Pin1 can accelerate the isomerization rate of pS/T-P motifs by orders of magnitude. The NMR experiments reported here show that Pin1 directly interacts with and isomerizes the phosphoS110-P111 peptide bond in a phosphopeptide corresponding to the IRAK-M sequence 103-124 (pIRAK-M), and also acts on the corresponding peptide harboring the phosphomimetic mutation S110E. Assembly of IRAK-M into the TLR signaling complex is mediated by its N-terminal death domain. Oligomerization is a hallmark of Death Domains (DD).  The IRAKM-DD has eluded structure determination due to aggregation. Here, we report the 1H, 13C and 15N backbone and side chain resonance assignments for a double-mutant IRAK-M Death Domain (R56D, Y61E) that is a highly soluble monomer well suited for NMR studies. Furthermore, we solved IRAK-M Death Domain structure and simulated docking prediction.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:15Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

A review of the hierarchy problem is presented along with some of the model building tools used to solve it, followed by a complementary review of extra dimensional models which emphasizes their relation to the hierarchy problem. Several new ideas for addressing the hierarchy problem are presented in this thesis as well as their experimental manifestation. Aspects of models which exhibit neutral naturalness are explored, and it is shown that Twin Higgs models with a full mirror sector can be cosmologically viable. New signals of such a scenario include an excess contribution to the dark radiation energy density measured by the the cosmic microwave background and sterile neutrino signals at future beam dump experiments. The method of searching for long-lived Higgs boson decay products at the Large Hadron Collider is presented as the best strategy for constraining models of neutral naturalness. Another category of natural models with long-lived particles, supersymmetric models with R-parity violation, is explored and the leading bounds are derived. Finally, several ideas which were introduced to explain the infamous 750 GeV excess of 2015 are provided.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:16Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The IoT has great potential to improve the efficiency of our homes and businesses. It also has the potential to severly undermine individual privacy. IoT devices generally report their states and sensor readings to their manufacturer at frequent intervals. This enables an unprecedented automated collection of information on ordinary citizens on a scale never-before possible. This information may seem trivial at first glance, but can in fact reveal a great deal of sensitive information.  Privacy mechanisms offer a potential solution to this problem. A privacy mechanism is an algorithm that enables one to enjoy the benefits of a service without revealing too much personal information. The IoT raises new privacy concerns that existing privacy mechanisms have not been designed to handle. These new problems require new methods to design privacy mechanisms. Engineering design is nothing without engineering analysis, however. We will also need new tools to quantify the privacy afforded by a mechanism and its effect on the utility of the service in question. This dissertation presents three main contributions to the design and analysis of privacy mechanisms for the IoT. It begins with a technical, ethical, and legal examination of online advertisement and ad blocking. Online ads are simultaneously an economic driving force behind the increasing collection of personal information as well as a mechanism enabling said collection. As such, they are integral to any examination of a privacy in the IoT. The next contribution is in the field of location privacy. GPS-enabled IoT devices that users carry on their bodies, such as smartphones, enable broad collection of location information on individuals. Location information is some of the most sensitive information collected by the IoT and is therefore one of the most significant research problems in IoT privacy. The dissertation lays out the analysis and design of location privacy mechanisms that focuses on hiding the semantic information in location data rather than the geographical coordinates themselves. The third contribution shows how the IoT can be used to enhance privacy instead of undermine it. It presents the design of a tamperproof log that can operate in a low-power, low-connectivity IoT network. The tamperproof log enables enforcement of an accountability policy that can be used to protect the privacy of medical records delivered to emergency physicians during disaster response.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:16Z (GMT).

Initiatives to improve and restore pollinator habitat have become increasingly popular. However, to most effectively conserve pollinators, we need a better understanding of which habitats are limiting to their survival and growth at the landscape scale. Our study examined the performance of the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens (Cresson), in four common landscapes (natural, suburban, conventional agriculture, and organic agriculture). In the summers of 2016 and 2017, 64 commercial bumble bee colonies were deployed across 16 sites (4 in each landscape) and their growth (weight and bee abundance) and fitness (caste production), and survival were monitored weekly. Across both years, colonies in suburban landscapes were approximately 28-30% lighter, had 13-15% less bee abundance, produced 38-40% fewer worker cells, and 45-50% fewer drones cells. Colonies in suburban landscapes also experienced queen death at a rate two-times faster. In 2016, 100% of the colonies in suburban landscapes were removed due to queen death, which was six days earlier than the overall average across all landscapes. In 2017, over 50% of the suburban colonies had queens die before the overall average across all landscapes. Our study adds to the growing literature highlighting the influence of the landscape context on pollinator populations, particularly in suburban environments. Overall, our results suggest that suburban landscapes are suboptimal for B. impatiens while agricultural landscapes were not detrimental to colony growth or survival. Future research is needed to identify mechanisms that are responsible for the reduced performance of bumble bee colonies in suburban landscapes, especially regarding floral resources, pesticides, and pathogens.

One of the biolubricants, lubricin, demonstrates boundary mode lubrication and chondroprotective abilities that arise from its composition and structure. As a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of joint diseases such as osteoarthrosis (OA), the challenge to produce lubricin recombinantly restricts its clinical application, which inspires the design of synthetic molecules that mimic lubricin‚Äôs structure. In this dissertation, a class of lubricin mimetic diblock copolymers, consisting of a cationic cartilage binding block and a brush lubrication block, are synthesized and their tribological properties are evaluated in comparison to lubricin (Chapter 2). Like lubricin, the tribological properties of these polymers are dependent on the molecular architecture. The roles of structure are explored to characterize how changing the molecular architecture affects the lubrication on cartilage surfaces and the results are summarized as a set of design principles of synthetic lubricants (Chapter 3). Additionally, this class of polymers demonstrates their ability to bind to and lubricate bone surfaces, which is absent in natural lubricin, thus extending its potential application as a therapeutic approach for OA treatment (Chapter 4).		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:18Z (GMT).

The various mechanisms of intercolony transmission of the Varroa mite were investigated by examining the behavior of both mites and their honey bee hosts.  Behavioral observations of mites and bees interacting on flowers demonstrated the plausibility of indirect mite transmission between colonies, using flowers as an intermediate substrate and staging ground for the infestation of new hosts.  Experimentally placed boxes containing honey in combs were robbed by free-living bees in a forest setting, demonstrating the likelihood of mite transmission between colonies via honey robbing behavior.  Detailed observations of worker and drone bees from light-colored colonies infested with a large number of Varroa mites and from nearby dark-colored colonies infested with few mites allowed us to correlate bee behavior with changes in mite populations.  These correlations reveal that mites from dying colonies are carried into healthy colonies when the healthy colonies rob honey from the sick ones, and to a lesser extent when infested bees drift from the sick colonies into the nearby healthy ones.  These investigations, taken together, show that the mechanisms of horizontal intercolony transmission have been underestimated in forests like the Arnot Forest.  After demonstrating these multiple mechanisms of intercolony mite transmission, even when colonies are widely spaced as in forests, we reconsidered the earlier hypothesis that Varroa mites in the Arnot Forest had evolved avirulence.  Instead, we investigated the behavioral mechanisms the Arnot Forest bees may be using to resist infestation by Varroa mites.  We have demonstrated that the Arnot Forest bees possess multiple behavioral traits (brood hygienic behavior and mite grooming behavior) at high levels, which appear to confer partial resistance to Varroa mites.  These traits are expressed at levels higher than is found in unselected populations, but lower than is found in populations that have been consistently selected by queen breeders for each trait, though whether this intermediate expression is adaptive or the result of incomplete evolution is still unclear.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:18Z (GMT).

However, the current approach suffers from an important limitation. While the subject matter expert can leverage his or her knowledge and expertise with past systems to identify areas of risk and features of interest in the datasets available, the next generation of EDL systems may present unprecedented challenges that may be missed by the human. Landing humans on Mars, for example, will pose unprecedented challenges to EDL technologies driven by the need to land larger payload mass with extremely high reliability and safety requirements. The goal of this research is to advance the state of the art for offline Intelligent Data Understanding (IDU) technologies for Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) by incorporating an intelligent assistant- called Daphne/EDL - that supports humans in architecting problems specific to the field of EDL. In this thesis, we describe a first prototype of the Daphne/EDL assistant in the context of three use cases to cover a range of representative problems in EDL architecture analysis and to show the capabilities of the assistant to support those use cases. Specifically, we demonstrate the baseline functionalities of the EDL assistant that include: 1) preliminary analysis capabilities of simulation datasets; 2) extraction of performance metrics from a historical database; and 3) automated generation of a scorecard. The scorecard contains metrics critical to assess EDL architecture performance. The assistant highlights metrics that fall out of spec of a design and communicates them to the subject-matter expert.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:19Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

While significant strides have been made in recent years in evolving the cathode chemistry and electrolyte formulations to meet higher energy storage demands, almost all contemporary LIB designs rely on flammable electrolyte solvents that are fundamentally unsafe. In this thesis, we explore crosslinked polymer networks as safe electrolytes for Lithium based battery systems. We thoroughly investigate the ion conduction mechanisms in these networks and exploit their degrees of freedom to create multifunctional electrolytes. We then report a facile UV cross-linking chemistry that can be used to create ion-conducting polymer networks containing dangling chains that impart specific, desired functionalities to liquid electrolytes. We show in particular that incorporation of monofunctional sulfonate and phosphate species in a photo-/heat-initiated cross-linking reaction of a multifunctional oligomer provides a straightforward route to mechanically robust membranes able to transform both transport properties and flammability of standard liquid electrolytes incorporated in their pores. We evaluate the physical and mechanical properties of the materials and on that basis report that dangling functional groups in the membrane pores can improve electrolyte properties, without compromising performance in electrochemical cells. Such cross-linked membranes with different pendant groups covalently tethered to an ion-conducting framework are argued to provide an important platform for more broadly enhancing lithium battery performance.		2/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:20Z (GMT).

In birds, the sum of knowledge on this topic is restricted to just two precocial families, Megapodidae and Anatidae, where data suggests developmental temperature can have significant effects on avian phenotypes, with important implications for future survival and fitness.  In these four chapters, I provide the theoretical justification for future studies on developmental plasticity based on previous experiments and provide an analytical framework for study. In addition, I use both experimental and long-term datasets to analyze the effects of costly developmental environments in a model Passerine bird, the Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor).  Emerging research is beginning to illustrate the developmental environment in birds has the potential to expand our understanding of what drives fitness, survival, and the evolution of life history traits in birds.

With the development of genetically encoded calcium indicators, optical imaging has enabled in vivo activity recordings from increasingly large neuronal populations with high spatial and temporal resolution. The synergy between calcium imaging and three-photon microscopy can potentially allow functional imaging beyond the depth limit of two-photon microscopy. However, the transition of three- photon microscopy from structural to functional imaging of high temporal resolution requires orders of magnitude stronger signal. The challenge was eventually overcome by the optimization of three-photon microscopy and the improvement of calcium indicators and their genetic expression. Currently, the technology has been adopted by many researchers for biological and neuroscience studies. In this thesis, the performance of three-photon microscopy with 1300-nm excitation and two-photon microscopy with 920-nm excitation are quantified and compared for in vivo imaging of GCaMP6s-labeled neurons. 1300-nm three-photon microscopy is more suited for imaging in the deep cortex of the mouse brain or beyond because it is more power-efficient for signal generation and has significantly higher signal-to-background ratio. These advantages are the results of the reduced light attenuation at the longer excitation wavelength and the improved three- dimensional confinement by high order nonlinear excitation. Furthermore, we demonstrated three-photon calcium imaging of ~ 150 GCaMP6s-labeled neurons in the mouse hippocampus at ~1-mm depth within an intact mouse brain. The imaging achieved 8.5 frame/s speed and 200 √ó 200 Œºm field-of-view. With ~50 mW average power at 800 kHz repetition rate, we were able to image the same regions in the hippocampus of several animals over multiple days, which manifested the safety and consistency of the method. Three-photon microscopy also finds another surprising application in imaging through the intact mouse skull. Compared to two-photon- excitation, even with the same long excitation wavelength and imaging system, three- photon-excitation significantly improves optical sectioning in presence of the skull- induced scattering and aberration. Through the intact adult mouse skull, we demonstrated three-photon imaging of vasculature at >500 Œºm depth, and GCaMP6s- calcium imaging over weeks in cortical layers 2/3 and 4 in awake mice, with 8.5 frames/s and hundreds of micrometers field-of-view.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:21Z (GMT).

In the past decades, robots were mainly seen in factories with confined and structured environments. Increasingly, robots are moving out of situated environments and are starting to operate in unstructured and dynamic environments. With the change of operating environment, many more environment events can arise during robot task execution. Robots need to cope with these events, sometimes anticipated and sometimes not, and be able to finish their assigned tasks. In this work, I present three approaches to increase robustness in robot task execution when unexpected situations arise. The approaches span low-level robot controllers and high-level robot controllers, and include both offline and online solutions. The first contribution is an offline approach that automatically adapts and transfers robot programs between robots, leveraging the Robot Operating System (ROS). The approach reduces the time spent on retrofitting existing programs on new robots and speeds up the time from robot software development to execution. The robot programs considered in the first contribution are often referred to as low-level robot controllers, retrieving sensor information from the robot and sending commands to the robot. They are usually executed alongside with high-level controllers, which process commands or specifications from users. The low-level and high-level controllers are inter-connected but their relationships and interactions are rarely inspected. The second contribution is an approach that inspects low-level controllers and proposes changes to the corresponding high-level specification, based on potential conflicts among the low-level controllers. The approach addresses the disconnect between high-level and low-level controllers which can lead to execution errors. The final contribution is an approach that increases robustness when unexpected environment events arise in the execution of high-level robot controllers. These events may involve uncontrolled environment behaviors or other robots operating in the same workspace, resulting in unpredictable robot behaviors during task execution. The approach automatically adapts the robot controller when these environment events occur, such that the robot can finish its task safely. Throughout the work, the approaches demonstrate how to cope with different unexpected situations and increase robustness during robot task execution.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:21Z (GMT).

This approach, collaborative landscape conservation (CLC), encourages coordinating conservation across entire ecosystems, and employs a transjurisdictional, partnership-based model of planning and management implementation. Despite its potential advantages, the CLC model faces obstacles, including how to ensure transboundary conservation goals can be achieved through local management actions. This dissertation seeks to articulate characteristics of the CLC planning model, the general processes through which this model operates, and how CLC initiatives can avoid planning-implementation gaps. It draws on insights from 155 semi-structured interviews with CLC initiative coordinators, development team participants formally involved in CLC planning, and potential end-users of CLC planning products. My findings highlight the potential contributions of local stakeholder participation and social data integration to mitigating planning-implementation gaps. I present a tentative model of cross-level coordination that might facilitate resource conservation across complex social-ecological landscapes and describe factors contributing to (1) horizontal and vertical collaboration in CLC and (2) the capacity of a CLC initiative to generate conservation goals and planning-support tools likely to be used in local management planning. I present a model of best practices for facilitating end-user participation in CLC planning and promoting adoption of CLC planning products. Results of my research indicate that local stakeholder participation and consideration of the human dimensions of landscapes targeted for conservation can provide a range of benefits, including (1) helping ensure landscape conservation goals are feasible, (2) CLC planning products are useful, usable, and trustworthy, and (3) local stakeholders are aware of landscape conservation initiatives and resources generated by these initiatives. Encouraging a social-ecological approach to CLC planning may require organizational and cultural shifts heightening valuation of local and social considerations in conservation planning, investments of time to understand local socio-political, cultural, and economic conditions, and investments of resources to facilitate effective participation opportunities.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:22Z (GMT).

In four papers, spanning different areas of study (social decision-making, self-regulation, adult-attachment), I examined how social-cognitive dynamics enable flexible adaptation to the environment. In Paper 1, across two studies, I show that social category cues (i.e., partner-attractiveness) can color interpersonal judgments about unknown others. But, despite the persisting effect of such cues, participants showed evidence of learning partner-utility information and overtime made choices that maximized profits. In Paper 2, I examined intraindividual variability in delaying of gratification (DG), across four studies. Multilevel analyses revealed that ~25% of the variability (Studies 1-3) in perceived success at DG was attributable to inter-individual variability. But, much of the variability (~75%, Studies 1-3) was attributable to intra-individual variability. I showed that individuals‚Äô personal construals, like active pursuit of and value of delayed rewards (e.g., being healthy) and whether DG is perceived as easy/difficult, explained intra-individual variability in success at DG. Therefore, beyond the nominal/objective situation, an individual‚Äôs subjective construals of the situation allow for examining when and why individuals delay or not. In Paper 3, across two studies, I show that merely sharing an experience/context can affect impression formation. In Study 1, when the participant was socially excluded along with another player (i.e., co-excluded), we found that the co-excluded was evaluated more positively compared to the excluders. In Study 2, I show that the positivity towards the co-excluded is not merely a contrast effect of increased negativity towards the excluders or a reconnection effect following exclusion. Therefore, not just perceiver or target related characteristics drive impressions but the encountered context also can affect them. Lastly, in Paper 4 the malleability of attachment security/insecurity in response to partner-responsiveness was examined. In two studies, implicitly pairing smiling (i.e., accepting; Study 1 and 2) versus disgust (i.e., rejecting; Study 2) faces with distressing (vs. neutral) stimuli primed the processing speed for words signaling general secure attachment (Study 1) or partner evaluative words that signal security (vs. insecurity; Study 2). Specifically, accepting faces, during distress led to strong association with secure attachment and partner evaluative words but rejecting faces during distress led to association with insecure partner evaluative words. Thus, as evidenced by the aforementioned studies, social-cognitive dynamics do enable flexible adaptation to interactions and changes in one‚Äôs environment.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:23Z (GMT).

As such, they provide a compelling empirical and theoretical tool for improving our understanding of the ownership and control of organizations outside of the Anglo-American tradition. However, widely incorporating business groups into analyses of regions like the Middle East has been limited by the availability of information on group membership. This paper seeks to advance the comparative study of corporate governance by demonstrating a method for inferring these groups with data on director-firm and ownership networks of publicly traded companies using data for 1336 listed firms from 12 Arab countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Group-level measures are then calculated based on information aggregated from firms affiliated with each potential group. These data are used to support the validity of the communities by showing that---based on scores of family influence, geographic heterogeneity, and government ownership---it is possible to identify groups corresponding to one of these specific and measurable axes of solidarity. Chapter 3: Although business groups have been intensely studied in regions like Latin America and East Asia, the literature on the Middle East and North Africa is relatively less developed; the sparsity of this research is a pressing concern because of the variety of ways in which business groups have been shown to influence the political allocation of economic resources in these other parts of the world. This study presents evidence for the value-relevance of family business groups, government ownership, and other inter-firm relationships among 1110 publicly traded firms in 12 countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Due to the difficulty in obtaining direct observations of business group membership, business groups are inferred with methods from network analysis. Next, I apply a Bayesian multilevel model to estimate the associations between group-comembership(as well as other relationships), and pairwise stock returns correlations. Using the results of the model, I perform an exploratory analysis of the correlations between exchange-level attributes and estimated cofficient values, finding that, despite the small number of exchanges, minority-investor protections appear to be associated with stronger value-relevance of business groups. Chapter 4: We use a novel data set of the outcomes of 18125 loan guarantee transactions attempted by Chinese public firms between 2008 and 2015 to study banks' reactions to related party transactions in the context of ongoing marketization reforms. We find that guaranteed loans with better governed guarantors from more marketized provinces are more likely to succeed, that the influence of political ties is contingent on the ownership structure of the guarantor, and that the embeddedness of the transaction in multiplex relationships between the guarantor and bank increases the likelihood of approval.		2/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:23Z (GMT).

The first two chapters are focused on a market level analysis. The first chapter develops a framework to evaluate the labor market effects of different types of educational expansions in four labor market outcomes: (1) the occupational structure of employment; (2) the assignment of workers with different level of education to occupations; (3) the wage level for each educational group; and (4) the wage gaps between educational groups. I evaluate three policy experiments consistent on increasing secondary schooling, increasing higher education, and increasing both. In the second Chapter, I apply the framework to study the case of Brazil, a country that underwent a major educational expansion during the period 1995-2014. I provide some new stylized facts for Brazil on the inter-linkages between changes in education, occupations, and wages over the period of 1995-2014‚Äî changes in outcomes (1)-(4). I found that: (a) the occupational structure of employment improved, but that improvement was very small when compared to the extension of the educational expansion; (b) the conditional occupational attainment declined for each educational group‚Äîprimary or less, secondary, and university; (c) and average wages increased but not for all educational groups since wages of primary educated workers increased while wages of more educated workers declined; (d) there were large reductions in inequality as measured by educational wage gaps. Then, I show that the model‚Äôs predictions for the Brazilian educational expansion are qualitatively consistent with the patterns observed in the data. I further demonstrate that, after calibrating the model, the educational expansion in Brazil was of utmost importance for generating the observed quantitative changes in the labor market. In the last chapter, I moved from a market level to an individual level analysis to evaluate the effect of a negative educational shock on workers‚Äô lifetime earnings. In particular, I examine how school disruptions caused by teacher strikes in Argentina affect students‚Äô long-run outcomes by exploiting cross-cohort variation in the prevalence of teacher strikes within and across provinces in Argentina in a difference-in-difference framework. I find robust evidence that teacher strikes worsen the future labor market outcomes of students when they are between 30 and 40 years old.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:24Z (GMT).

Utilizing the USDA-PGRU Malus germplasm collection, two projects were conducted to address these concerns. The first project characterized fruit quality and juice chemistry for a target population of 308 accessions with the goal of identifying accessions with desirable characteristics for hard cider production. The second project used the same sample population to explore the use of the Ma1 and Q8 genes as potential markers to predict the concentration of titratable acidity of cider apples. An initial target population of 308 accessions were identified and 158 accessions were assessed in 2017 for external and internal fruit characteristics along with juice chemistry. As per the Long Ashton Research Station (LARS) cider apple classification system where apples with tannin concentration (measured with the L√∂wenthal Permanganate Titration method) greater than 2.0 g‚Ä¢L-1 are classified as bitter, and those with a malic acid concentration greater than 4.5 g‚Ä¢L-1 are classified as sharp, 29% of the 158 accessions would be classified as bittersweet, 13% bittersharp, 28% sweet (neither bitter nor sharp), and 30% sharp. In addition, the polyphenol composition of 14 genotypes was measured using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography. and indicated that the variation in polyphenol levels measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu assay was largely due to procyanidins and phloretin compounds. In Chapter 3, the accessions phenotyped in the 2017 harvest season were also genotyped for the Ma1 and Q8 genes and fit to a linear model where measured titratable acidity was the response variable and the Ma, Q8 and combined Ma1 and Q8 genotypes were used as predictor variables in two separate models. An ANOVA indicates that the Ma1 gene was found to be a reliable predictor of fruit titratable acidity (P = < 0.0001), but the Q8 gene was not (P = 0.48). Combining both genes in the analysis was not a better predictor than using the Ma1 gene alone (P = 0.27). From there an estimated marginal means model, was able to demonstrate a series of non-overlapping 99% confidence intervals for the means titratable acidity concentrations of each Ma1 allele. Additionally, an estimated marginal means test of the Ma1 alleles was able to accurately predict the acidity classification as per the 4.5 g‚Ä¢L-1 threshold for the LARS cider apple classification system. Thus, a gene-based classification system of cider apples is proposed, with the titratable acidity levels defined by the Ma1 allele thresholds of 5.26 and 7.82 g‚Ä¢L-1. The advantage of a genetically based classification system is that it could be used for marker assisted breeding and it would not be subject to horticultural, seasonal, or geographic variability. Together, these two projects defined procedures for rapid phenotyping and genotyping of germplasm collections for addressing the needs of the emerging hard cider industry. Additionally, the characterization of cider apples for juice quality identified 49 bittersweet and 21 bittersharp genotypes that should be further evaluated for their suitability to perform in commercial orchards.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:24Z (GMT).

In everyday language, phrases such as "warm embrace" are often utilized in situations where social connections are of interest, and words of similar nature are also used to describe personality traits. Although a growing body of empirical research has consistently demonstrated that physical warmth is closely linked to social intimacy and proximity, extant research has not examined whether the presence of romantic partners is similarly associated with physical warmth. The studies presented in this dissertation were the first ones to investigate the link between romantic partner presence and perception of physical warmth and reveal that imagining romantic partner presence or absence altered thermal perceptions. Across five studies, it was consistently found that simply imagining being together with the partner was associated with feelings of warmth, whereas imagining being separated from the partner was associated with feelings of coldness. Moreover, thinking about partner absence (vs. partner presence or a control scenario) was associated with a greater desire for warm activities potentially to compensate for the feelings of coldness. Together, these findings extend the consistent findings on the link between social and physical warmth to romantic relationships and provide further evidence for the regulatory role of romantic relationships and the robust link between physical warmth and interpersonal affection.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:26Z (GMT).

This thesis contains several contributions toward this effort. The first chapter gives a brief introduction. The next two chapters describe applications and extensions of existing techniques to specific problems. First we consider the task of creating gaits for legged robots and describe the performance of various learning algorithms for automating generation of quadruped gaits. Notably, labels employed for learning are gather entirely for real-world experiments run in the learning loop. This results in a challenging learning scenario with limited labels, but through the use of models with the appropriate assumptions, gaits are found that are nine times faster than those designed by hand. In the next chapter, we discuss the task of enabling easier design of three dimensional (3D) shapes via machine learning. We describe the front end presentation and back end algorithms that enabled non-expert users to generate millions of shapes online. The remaining chapters describe approaches to understand network training and behavior. The first details several visualizations useful for training Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and an application to a synthetic 3D data set. The second investigates a basic property of trained neural networks: to what extent parameters learned on one task can be transferred to another task. The third discusses the Deep Visualization Toolbox, open source software written to aid in understanding individual neurons in the middle of a large neural network. An additional chapter is supplied in the appendix as the author of this thesis and another researcher contributed equally to it. In this final section, the local vs. distributed nature of neural network representations is studied experimentally.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:25Z (GMT).

Taking the two identified and well-documented phases of relationships in adulthood, romantic infatuation and adult attachment, this dissertation investigates the transition from the attachment-in-the-making infatuation phase to a fully-fledged attachment relationship with a romantic partner.  First, a theoretical argument is presented presenting a speculative hypothesis of how this transition happens neurochemically.  Through interactions with oxytocin and endocannabinoid receptors and heterodimers, the reward system is shifted to favor familiar and satisfying reward over novel and exciting rewards.  Because of this, the reward of attachment is maintained indefinitely and encoded in mu-opiate receptor activation, while infatuation reward, driven by dopamine, ultimately fades over time.  This results in the observed phenomenology of each of these phases across individuals, time, and culture.  Based on this theoretical model of neurological change between infatuation and attachment, a study was conducted to identify a possible biological marker of attachment formation through pupillary reactions to partner mental representations.  Because norepinephrine, identified as high during infatuation and low during attachment, can affect the contraction of iris muscles, it is hypothesized that bringing the partner to mind would cause pupil dilation during infatuation and pupil constriction during attachment.   While there was little constriction, there was significantly greater pupil dilation during infatuation than attachment, as well as before many relationship milestones including relationship length.  It is possible that this could be used as an unconscious marker of infatuation, and subsequently attachment formation, in adults.  Finally, in order to better understand the phenomenology and timing of this transition, a large survey was distributed to examine current and past relationships.  Using a classification analysis, the time between eighteen months and thirty months was identified as a time of transition, which aligns with earlier research.  However, these data point to the time not being a clean transition, but a gradual one where aspects of both infatuation and attachment are simultaneously experienced.  Thus, this dissertation provides a foundation for building further theoretical and empirical work investigating the transition into adult romantic attachment.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:26Z (GMT).

Depending on the chemical incompatibility of the blocks and their volume fractions, they self-segregate into microdomains inducing anisotropy and different symmetries to the microstructure, resulting in significant variability in the macroscopic properties.   DBPs are emerging as a candidate for replacing conventional liquid electrolytes in electrochemical devices, due to their improved chemical and mechanical stability. In contrast to isotropic melts, the self-segregation of DBPs allows the decoupling of ionic transport and mechanical properties. In this work, molecular dynamic simulations of coarse-grained DBPs were devised and carried out to unveil correlations between the microstructure and both ionic mobility ($\mu$), and dynamics/viscoelasticity (directly correlate with mechanical properties) of DBPs.   It was found that across different morphologies and chain lengths ($N$), $\mu$ is mainly controlled by the extent of microdomains mixing and the tortuosity of the conductive path. Furthermore, the local fluctuations in the density of the polymer matrix have a non-negligible effect on the transport of ions.  Our study of dynamic and viscoelastic properties of DBPs revealed that the interface between the two blocks constrains chain conformations in a way akin to topological constraints caused by entanglements. Specifically, the DBP interface gives rise to a temperature-dependent early crossover from Rouse to reptation scaling of the self-diffusion coefficient with $N$ compared to isotropic melts. Rheologically, the interface manifests into a modulus plateau similar to that of the rubbery plateau of entangled polymer melts that arises at the same Rouse to reptation scaling crossover $N$. Overall, the results of this study shed some light on the effects of various design and operating parameters, such as block composition, temperature, and external forces, on the transport properties of DBPs. It is expected that these results will provide a fundamental basis to complement ongoing experimental and modeling efforts devoted to engineer DBPs for target applications.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:27Z (GMT).

Urban areas encroach surrounding landscapes, creating a mosaic of patchy and dynamic development. Across the United States and in many parts of the world, turfgrass ecosystems are a primary groundcover in urban areas. When studied at larger scales, turf lawns coalesce into urban grasslands, a distinct vegetation type that can be studied, characterized, and compared to more well-studied ecosystems. To date, studies of urban grasslands have documented a general increase in soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) associated with managed turf, but fewer studies have focused on the microbial mediation of soil nutrient dynamics in these novel urban ecosystems. 	We sought to 1) search the literature for common turfgrass management practices that have been demonstrated to affect urban grassland soil microbiomes; 2) compare the microbiome composition, activity, and microbial biomass in a chronosequences of lawns established on either formerly agricultural- or forest-history soils to reference agricultural and forest history reference sites; and 3) elucidate the effect of litter quality on the lawn chronosequences to determine if there was an interaction with land-use history or the soil microbiome as might be suggested by current frameworks integrating litter quality, microbial physiology, and soil organic matter formation (e.g. MEMS and MIMICS). 	Cultural management practices, particularly mowing, are required to maintain quality turf and can alter nutrient cycling in the rhizosphere and at the soil surface depending on how clippings or fall leaf-litter is managed. We found significant shifts in soil microbiome composition when lawns were established on forest-history soils, but not agricultural-history soils. Compositional shifts were related to changing edaphic conditions, particularly pH, %N and %C as lawns aged. We found that short-term additions of litter did not alter the soil microbiome composition, but did affect soil microbial biomass and soil C and N. Relatively more-labile grass clippings stimulated soil C and N accumulation and lower-quality leaf litter increased soil microbial biomass. These observations agree with current soil organic matter models that explicitly consider microbial physiology.  	Overall, we found land-use history to be a highly significant, but relatively poor predictor of lawn soil microbiome composition. However, the nature of the patterns in lawns were influenced by the previous land-uses, and therefore may still be informative for understanding microbial composition and function at landscape scales. Soil physiochemical conditions, especially pH, were much stronger predictors of lawn microbiomes. Future land-use change studies would benefit from considerations of edaphic conditions rather than generalizations about vegetative cover. The continued study of urban grasslands and urban ecosystems is needed to advance the knowledge of these novel ecosystems and provide the basis for improving their sustainable management."		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:27Z (GMT).

In partnership with a nonprofit called the Coalition for Healthy School Food, this study targeted two entr√©es under the brand of Cool School Food (CSF): Ms. Patel‚Äôs Rajma ("Rajma") and West African Beans & Greens (WABG). Children‚Äôs choice, consumption, knowledge and perceptions of CSF are used as indicators of acceptance, with choice or demand being the primary focus.  The interventions were implemented on a school-wide basis and consisted of: samples offered in the lunch line of the weekly CSF special; recipe-specific morning announcements; and recipe-specific posters and signs placed at children‚Äôs eye-level around the cafeteria and at the lunch line. A differences-in-differences research design is used to identify the interventions‚Äô impact on children‚Äôs acceptance. In this set-up, treatment status is assigned to two schools and control status is assigned to the other two schools. Observational and pre-post survey data is collected in all four schools. The observational dataset consists of 3,319 trays or child-days. Three-hundred ninety-eight students are represented in the survey dataset, 174 of which took both the pre- and post-survey. The interventions evaluated in this study did not conclusively demonstrate an effect on selection or consumption of Cool School Food as a whole. They were, however, found to clearly and positively impact correlates of demand, like knowledge, taste exposure through sampling and liking among new consumers of CSF, as well as demand for Rajma upon replication of the interventions. Specifically, the interventions had a positive but statistically insignificant impact on the probability of selecting CSF, increasing it by 5.2%, which is roughly equivalent to an additional 10 CSF meals selected for a school lunch population of 200 students. Taking a closer look, the second round of interventions for Rajma were found to significantly increase the probability of selecting Rajma by 6.5%. The interventions were also found to significantly increase the probability of affirmatively knowing what CSF, Rajma, and WABG is by 39.4%, 42.8% and 32.4%, respectively. There is moreover evidence that the interventions led more students to try CSF and improved attitudes toward CSF among those who had not tried it prior to the study. Specifically, the interventions increased the probability of sampling Rajma and WABG during the intervention period by 29.5% and 25.5%, respectively. There are consistently strong entr√©e effects on the various indicators of acceptance used.  These findings suggest that the effectiveness of simple marketing tools like tastings, recipe-specific announcements, and posters and signs may depend on the entr√©e targeted and the number of replications of the interventions, which may produce larger and more pronounced effects if sustained over time. All in all, the interventions evaluated show promise for future use and study, and this research contributes to our understanding of children‚Äôs acceptance of healthy, plant-based entr√©es. The acceptance of these kinds of foods will shape what kind of role their increased consumption can have in improving human and environmental health, as well as whether they can have a role at all.

This phenotypic shaping is a dynamic process that involves sequences of distinct social environments across stages of development. Unfortunately, research on the environmental effects on brain development and behavior too often focuses on individual periods of life. This prevents an understanding of how sequences of life stages could interactively shape phenotypes over developmental time. Here I first describe the development of oxytocin and vasopressin receptors in the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) and demonstrate the influence of juvenile social and spatial enrichment on brain development. These developmental trajectories and their responses to enrichment are highly region-specific, and somewhat sex-specific. Notably, the general patterns of trajectories for oxytocin receptors (OTR) and for vasopressin receptors (V1aR) are highly distinct. Enrichment results in a male-specific reduction of V1aR across several brain regions, whereas OTR is strictly promoted following enrichment. I then demonstrate the interactive impacts of perinatal and juvenile social environments on oxytocin and vasopressin receptor development and social cognition. Male prairie voles that experience a two-hit model of social deprivation (single-mother rearing + social isolation) develop higher oxytocin and vasopressin receptors in specific regions, and also develop impaired social discrimination. Lastly, I provide support for how perinatal and juvenile social environments can interact to influence the behavioral effects of intranasal oxytocin. Males experiencing a two-hit model of social deprivation (single-mother rearing + social isolation) engage in promoted alloparental care behavior towards novel neonatal voles. Taken together, this research highlights the influence of interactive effects of consecutive social environments on neurobiology and behavior, and emphasizes the importance of considering multi-factorial dynamics on the developmental process in future studies.

However, the role of microbes in plant local adaptation is rarely tested. In a survey of the plant local adaptation literature, I found that the vast majority of studies that report local adaptation (94%) performed transplants into microbe-containing soils and measured traits that are microbe-mediated. In these studies, microbe-mediated effects are confounded with plant genotype effects. For my dissertation research, I sought to describe the phenomenon of microbe-mediated adaptation and provide a definitive test using a modified reciprocal transplant experiments that moved seeds and microbes into two habitats. Here I present my dissertation work in three chapters:  In my first chapter, I propose two ways in which microbes facilitate patterns of adaptation for plants, microbe-mediated local adaptation and microbe-mediated adaptive plasticity. Microbe-mediated local adaptation is when plant genotypes have higher fitness at their home site because of a genotype-specific affiliation with locally important microbe(s). Microbe-mediated adaptive plasticity is when a plant genotype has higher fitness in multiple habitats because it demonstrates plasticity in associating with locally important microbes.  In my second chapter, I describe soil conditions, plant phenotype, and microbial communities in two habitats. I used high-throughput tagged amplicon sequencing of SSU-rRNA genes (for bacteria) and ITS1 (for fungi) to characterize the root microbiome of Saint John‚Äôs wort, Hypericum perforatum. At each root sampling location, I quantified soil characteristics to evaluate habitat variables that are correlated with root microbial communities. I also collected information on plant growth and fecundity for each focal plant to identify microbes that are correlated with plant phenotype. We found that bacterial and fungal communities were significantly different between habitats. Community differences were correlated with soil nitrogen and pH, and two taxa in the phylum Actinobacteria were significantly correlated with plant height.  In my third chapter, I test for microbe-mediated adaptation using the two habitats, limestone barrens (alvars) and old-fields, described in chapter two. I conducted reciprocal transplant experiments in two years, exploring microbe effects on plant germination, survival, and growth. I found that alvar seeds had higher probability of germination when transplanted into home soils with microbes, but only when transplanted into their home habitat. Similarly, alvar seedlings had a higher probability of survival when transplanted into their home live soils, but here transplant site was unimportant. I also found local microbes inhibited local adaptation for old-field seedlings and facilitated local adaptation for alvar seedlings. My results indicate that microbial mutualists were important for plants growing in marginal alvar habitats, and that microbes changed patterns of local adaptation.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:29Z (GMT).

Our measurements on water are consistent with the generalized Clapeyron equation, which predict the relation between the pressure of the liquid, the pressure of the solid and the temperature at equilibrium. We also report and discuss remarkable behaviors in the kinetics of equilibration. We found that the equilibration time to reach chemical equilibrium can vary by several orders of magnitude. To better understand this observation, we do a more careful study of the dynamics of transport of supercooled water into ice using a custom-made microfluidic platform. Our results indicate that the dynamics is slower than the prediction of the generalized Clapeyron equation, assuming that the ice remains at atmospheric pressure. We speculate that the transport impacts the pressure in the ice and leads to an effectively lower driving force.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:29Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Each measure is zero if and only if the random vectors are mutually independent. The first generalizes distance covariance from pairwise dependence to mutual dependence, while the other two measures are sums of squared distance covariances. The proposed measures share similar properties and asymptotic distributions with distance covariance, and capture non-linear and non-monotone mutual dependence between the random vectors. Inspired by complete and incomplete V-statistics, we define empirical and simplified empirical measures as a trade-off between the complexity and statistical power when testing mutual independence. The implementation of corresponding tests is demonstrated by both simulation results and real data examples. Chapter 2 ‚Äì We apply both distance-based and kernel-based mutual dependence measures to independent component analysis (ICA), and generalize dCovICA to MDMICA, minimizing empirical dependence measures as an objective function in both deflation and parallel manners. Solving this minimization problem, we introduce Latin hypercube sampling (LHS), and a global optimization method, Bayesian optimization (BO) to improve the initialization of the Newton-type local optimization method. The performance of MDMICA is evaluated in various simulation studies and an image data example. When the ICA model is correct, MDMICA achieves competitive results compared to existing approaches. When the ICA model is misspecified, the estimated independent components are less mutually dependent than the observed components using MDMICA, while they are prone to be even more mutually dependent than the observed components using other approaches. Chapter 3 ‚Äì Independent component analysis (ICA) decomposes multivariate data into mutually independent components (ICs). The ICA model is subject to a constraint that at most one of these components is Gaussian, which is required for model identifiability. Linear non-Gaussian component analysis (LNGCA) generalizes the ICA model to a linear latent factor model with any number of both non-Gaussian components (signals) and Gaussian components (noise), where observations are linear combinations of independent components. Although the individual Gaussian components are not identifiable, the Gaussian subspace is identifiable. We introduce an estimator along with its optimization approach in which non-Gaussian and Gaussian components are estimated simultaneously, maximizing the discrepancy of each non-Gaussian component from Gaussianity while minimizing the discrepancy of each Gaussian component from Gaussianity. When the number of non-Gaussian components is unknown, we develop a statistical test to determine it based on resampling and the discrepancy of estimated components. Through a variety of simulation studies, we demonstrate the improvements of our estimator over competing estimators, and we illustrate the effectiveness of our test to determine the number of non-Gaussian components. Further, we apply our method to real data examples and show its practical value. Chapter 4 ‚Äì A crucial problem in statistics is to decide whether additional variables are needed in a regression model. We propose a new multivariate test to investigate the conditional mean independence of Y given X conditioning on some known effect Z, i.e., E(Y|X,Z) = E(Y|Z). Assuming that E(Y|Z) and Z are linearly related, we reformulate an equivalent notion of conditional mean independence through transformation, which is approximated in practice. We apply the martingale difference divergence (MDD) to measure conditional mean dependence, and show that the estimation error from approximation is negligible, as it has no impact on the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under some regularity assumptions. The implementation of our test is demonstrated by both simulations and a financial data example.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:30Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This oral commensal bacterium has been shown as the main contributor for many dental diseases, including periodontitis and gingivitis. Recently, evidence has verifying the linkage between F. nucleatum and carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are naturally occurring metabolic byproducts secreted by Gram-negative bacteria, and contain highly antigenic LPS and outer membrane protein residues. Due to its antigen containing and non-self-replicated properties, OMVs are emerging as a powerful platform for vaccine design and delivery. We speculated the OMVs from F. nucleatum might contain antigens able to elicit effective immune response. In this study, we identified 98 proteins from purified OMVs of F. nucleatum through proteomic studies. In silica analysis indicates the non-replicative OMVs of F. nucleatum contain a variety of antigenic virulence factors and may play a critical role in vaccine design.

As a model reactor system, the Taylor-Couette Reactor (TCR) allows for examining a range of hydrodynamic instabilities, while stimulating vortex motion, offering a highly active extensive interface for mass transfer, and multiphase mixing. Specifically, this dissertation assesses the effect of changing flow structure and mixing patterns in TCR on mass transport, for a range of multiphase flow reactions including crystal formation, particle functionalization and gas-liquid absorption. Overall, this dissertation confirms that it is not just the increase of energy of dissipation that is critical towards enhancing the mixing but rather the structure of the flow regimes, which if elaborately understood and characterized, enable us to exercise more effective control over the mass transfer in a reaction. The first part of this work focused on studies involving the precipitation of barium sulfate revealed that the emergence of vortex motion plays a critical role in fine-tuning crystal properties such as particle size. The second part focused on examining the influence of the onset of the primary Taylor vortex instability, as well as secondary instabilities, in tailoring the coating layer during the surface modification of metallic filler particles with methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS). The surface of aluminum fillers was modified with specific (H2C=C) functionality, offering a more uniform degree of coating, lower degree of aggregation, smoother surface and higher MPS coupling efficiency after the emergence of Taylor vortices, especially after the onset of modulated wavy vortex flow regime. The last part focused on investigating the variety of flow patterns in a three-phase system, reacting gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) with aqueous calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) to precipitate solid calcium carbonate crystals (CaCO3) in a TCR, to assess the influence of the corresponding flow dynamics, CO2 gas bubble size and interfacial area on the properties of the resulting CaCO3 crystals. It was found that identifying the emergence of the "ring flow" structure was critical to optimizing the interfacial area and fine-tuning crystal properties such as internal crystal pore structure, surface area, particle size and morphology.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:32Z (GMT).

Specifically, it seeks to explain how and why Jinling University and National Southeastern University achieved remarkable success in the early 1920s. Whereas the economic aspect of Republican China‚Äôs cotton textile manufacturing has been thoroughly discussed in existing research, little, if any, has been said on cotton breeding‚Äîthe fundamental solution for agricultural inefficiency paralyzing large-scale cotton textile manufacturing. This paper seeks to fill this vacuum. It finds that, in the Beiyang era, the outcomes of cotton breeding projects depended heavily on human capital. To be more specific, U.S educated cotton experts who acquired advanced agricultural know-how were at the heart of universities‚Äô success; governments‚Äô efforts did not translate into satisfactory direct results, because government-owned experimental farms were not managed by personnel equipped with know-how pertaining to the cultivation of American cotton species; the outcomes obtained at cotton industrialists‚Äô experimental farms were inadequate successes, because the amount of quality human capital available to them was inadequate.

The golden and white potato cyst nematodes (Globodera rostochiensis and G. pallida, respectively) are devastating quarantine pests of potatoes.  The most widely distributed pathotype of the golden nematode, Ro1, is well controlled by the H1 resistance gene. In chapter 1, two molecular markers linked to H1, 57R, and TG689, were evaluated for their ability to identify resistance against Ro1 among 38 cultivars and 350 New York breeding clones. The ability of either marker to predict resistance was high ‚Äì 99.7% and 98.3% for 57R and TG689, respectively ‚Äì demonstrating that either of these markers is sufficient to make selection decisions in a practical breeding program. Chapter 2 reports on a QTL analysis to map resistance against pathotype Ro2.  This pathotype overcomes the H1 gene and is currently present on several farms in New York State.  Two autotetraploid clones ‚Äì NY121 (Ro2 resistant) and NY115 (susceptible) ‚Äì along with 182 F1 offspring were genotyped with 8303 SNP markers and evaluated for resistance using a greenhouse pot assay.  Analysis with TetraploidSNPMap identified two resistance QTL on chromosome 5:  one was located at 26 cM and explained 24% of the variation for resistance, while the second at 59 cM co-localized with the H1 gene and explained 13% of the variation.  Subsequent inoculation with G. pallida revealed that the locus at 26 cM also conferred resistance against pathotype Pa2/3, explaining 9.2% of the variation. Chapter 3 reports the mapping of chip color and specific gravity QTL in the same NY121 x NY115 cross.  NY115 has often been used as a parent because it transfers exceptionally light chip color to many progeny.  Significant QTLs for chip color were detected across multiple years on chromosomes 3, 4, and 7, with the QTL on chromosome 7 explaining the most variation (13.3% across four years).   Significant QTL for specific gravity were repeatedly detected on chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, with the QTL on chromosome 4 explaining the most variation (10.5%)."		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:33Z (GMT).

Because N limits primary production, understanding interactions among these factors is central to predicting soil resource availability to primary producers and the global distribution of terrestrial biomass carbon (C). Phosphorus (P), another limiting nutrient, and C, further affect microbial N transformations and N bioavailability through the stoichiometric requirements of plant and microbial biomass. Natural environmental gradients coupled with field manipulations are investigative tools that have helped to elucidate controls on C, N and P interactions, particularly under conditions of environmental change. This work considered the influences of increasing mean annual temperature (MAT) and the relative availabilities of soil N and P on belowground plant activity, microbial functional groups, and N cycling rates in tropical and temperate forests. Past research showed that belowground C flux and soil respiration increased with warming across an elevation/MAT gradient (13-18.2 ¬∞C) in a tropical montane wet forest. Across the same gradient, this study found that soil N bioavailability and the abundance of nitrifying archaea also increased with warming, suggesting that MAT drives nitrifier populations and resultant N availability. The present study also showed that warming reduced fine root proliferation into soil microsites enriched with P or a combination of N and P across the gradient. This suggests that fine root growth is more co-limited by N and P at low MAT where bulk soil N is more limiting than in warm conditions where N is abundant. Additionally, arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization of fine roots increased with warming, possibly indicating that nutrient acquisition is performed by fungal symbionts more than fine roots in warm, N-rich environments. Using a stand fertilization experiment in a northern hardwood forest, this work showed that litter N:P and gross N cycling declined in the presence of elevated P, while microbial biomass N increased with elevated P. The results show that litter chemistry is strongly related to soil N and P limitation, and may control gross N cycling through litter substrate limitation. Together, these studies highlight the complex interplay among temperature, soil P availability, and plant/microbial nutrient uptake that shape the N cycle in different forest ecosystems.

Despite intense research over the last 50 years, we still lack a complete understanding of how bacteria maintain cell wall homeostasis. Here we attempt to integrate new data from the last few years with some established ideas in the field, and we propose a new model of cell wall biogenesis in rod-shaped bacteria (Chapter 1).  The lipid II cycle is central to peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis. A common C55 lipid carrier, undecaprenyl-pyrophosphate (UPP) is used for the synthesis of both peptidoglycan and wall teichoic acids to ferry precursors across the cytoplasmic membrane. Here we demonstrate that B. subtilis requires either one of two UPP phosphatases, UppP or BcrC, for the recycling of this essential molecule for continuous synthesis of cell wall (Chapter 2).  Peptidoglycan synthesis relies on intermediates derived from central metabolism. We found that an aspB mutant is auxotrophic for aspartate and lyses when grown on Difco sporulation medium due to limitation of the peptidoglycan precursor meso-2,6-diaminopimelate (mDAP), a downstream metabolic intermediate of aspartate. Interestingly, we found that when bacteria experience a shortage of aspartate, the first breakpoint is not protein but peptidoglycan synthesis, which predisposes them to cell wall weakness and sensitizes them to antibiotics targeting late steps of PG synthesis. This work highlights the ability of perturbations of central metabolism to sensitize cells to peptidoglycan synthesis inhibitors (Chapter 3). Bacillus subtilis uses alternative sigma factors to regulate gene transcription upon stresses. Being a powerful double-edged sword, it is essential to keep this regulatory network under check. Here we show that the absence of its anti-sigma factor(s) leads to dysregulation of SigM, which drives a positive feedback loop for its own synthesis and SigM accumulates to a toxic level. High SigM activity overproduces membrane proteins and causes protein secretion stress, which lead to cell morphology and severe growth defects (Chapter 4). Collectively, the work in this dissertation provides additional insights of essential pathways and gene regulation for cell wall homeostasis in Bacillus subtilis.		2/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:34Z (GMT).

Taking socio-economic characteristic of passenger as well as subjective and objective perception characteristic of BRT service into consideration, this paper aims to establish a user satisfaction model for BRT service and figure out whether frequency of riding BRT or public bus have impact on level of satisfaction. The estimated model show that (1) objective perception characteristic of BRT service has dominant influence on user satisfaction; (2) frequency of riding BRT and public buses is positively associated with user satisfaction; (3) people with lower income more likely have lower satisfaction while company clerks are more satisfied with the BRT service than other occupation.

RFBs are appealing as they lack phase change upon cycling, have modular interchangeable components and decouple power output from energy storage capacity. Even with all of these benefits RFBs are just being implemented commercially in large-scale installations as there are still some limitations. Current RFBs have low voltages (leading to low energy densities compared to traditional batteries), cyclability issues and problems with electrolyte crossover the membrane.  	 We propose a new class of RFBs designated as symmetric redox flow batteries (SRFBs) where the same parent electrolyte makes up both the anolyte and catholyte. The assignment of anolyte and catholyte is simply an electrochemical construct and is independent of the solution chemistry. SRFBs are less sensitive to membrane crossover effects. Diaminoanthraquinones (DAAQs) have been targeted as excellent SRFB charge storage compounds. After fundamental electrochemical screening several DAAQs 1,4-bis(isopropylamino)anthraquinone commonly known as disperse blue 134 was the most successful candidate. With 2 reduction and 2 oxidation states, and 2.7 V between them a disperse blue 134 SRFB has a theoretical energy density of 61 Wh/mole as opposed to 17 Wh/mole for the most widely researched all vanadium RFB.  A 0.81 Wh/L disperse blue 134 flow cell with > 80% coulombic efficiency and ~ 40% energy efficiency at 100% state of charge was successfully cycled with the identity of each electrolyte altered through charging current sign thus proving that not only an SRFB is possible but that disperse blue 134 is well paired to this technology."		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:36Z (GMT).

As these devices are fabricated with aluminum nitride (AlN), a CMOS-compatible piezoelectric thin film material, these devices can be integrated directly with CMOS circuits to allow for new circuit functionalities.  The structure and fabrication details of GHz sonar transducers are introduced, followed by a discussion of how to model the devices. There are two primary effects that will be discussed ‚Äì the electrical to acoustic conversion of the piezoelectric thin film transducers and how diffraction affects wave propagation from the transducers through the silicon substrate. In this work, three new applications enabled by the GHz sonar transducer will be discussed. The first is the GHz ultrasonic through-silicon via (UTSV), a new type of wireless 3D interconnect that enables chip-to-chip communication in multi-chip 3D integrated circuit (3DIC) stacks.   The second application is the GHz sonic memory ‚Äì a delay line memory that uses the UTSV as an ultrasonic delay line and stores digital bits as ultrasonic waves. The novelty of this memory is that it transforms the previously unused silicon substrate into 3D memory elements, as opposed to the traditional method of increasing memory density by stacking 2D memory chips.  The third application is the GHz ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, a new CMOS compatible fingerprint sensor. The use of ultrasound allows for numerous advantages over current capacitive and optical fingerprint sensors, including higher penetration through glass and metal layers, as well as enhancing the spoof resistance of the fingerprint sensor by allowing the sensor to image elastic properties of tissue. The 1.3 GHz frequency of the sensor potentially allows for two orders of magnitude higher resolution over existing ultrasonic fingerprint sensors, which typically operate at biomedical ultrasound frequencies of tens of MHz.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:37Z (GMT).

Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) is a treatment that uses a cancer patient's own T lymphocytes with anti-tumor activity, expanded in-vitro and re-infused into the patient. The ability to genetically engineer human lymphocytes and use them to mediate cancer regression in patients, which has recently been demonstrated, has opened possibilities for the extension of ACT immunotherapy to patients with a wide variety of cancer types and is a promising new approach to cancer treatment. Clinical monitoring of ACT utilizes serial blood analyses to discern T cell activity. While useful, these data are 1-dimensional and lack spatiotemporal information related to treatment efficacy or toxicity. In this dissertation, I have utilized a human genetic reporter, somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2), and PET, to quantitatively and longitudinally visualize whole-body T cell distribution and antitumor dynamics using a clinically approved radiotracer. Initial evaluations determined that SSTR2-expressing T cells were detectable at low densities with high sensitivity and specificity. While keeping a close eye on the status of immunotherapy is shown in the early part of this thesis, later topics address the ideal antigens to target tumors, more specifically targeting solid tumors. We turned to targeting inflammation, specifically intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), as an ideal marker for solid tumors. ICAM-1, which has been implicated to play a critical role in tumor progression in various types of cancer, has also been linked to cancer metastases, where this molecule facilitates the spread of metastatic cancer cells to secondary sites. The unique expression profile of ICAM-1 throughout solid tumor microenvironment makes ICAM-1 an intriguing molecular target, as evidence suggests that approximately 25% of all human cancer worldwide is associated with chronic inflammation. Utilizing ICAM1 as a target, I share the success of using an ICAM1 specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells to eliminate anaplastic thyroid cancer tumors, in a solid tumor mouse model. The first attempt was using the single-chain fragmentvariable of R6.5, an ICAM-1 specific antibody. Followed by the utilization of the active domain (I-domain) of the natural ligand to ICAM-1, lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1). For I-domain CAR, many engineered affinity variants were studies, to help determine the ideal antigen to affinity, to maintain CAR T cell persistence without any systemic toxicities sometimes observed with ACTs.		2/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:38Z (GMT).

In this thesis, I use Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) geodesy to constrain mechanisms of magma storage, transfer and eruption in a wide range of eruptions in the SVZ spanning from small Strombolian (VEI 1-2) to large Plinian (VEI 4-5). In general, ground deformation of 101-102 cm is only recorded during VEI 4-5 eruptions, while the VEI 1-2 events tend to lack signals of this magnitude. Eruptions in the SVZ are triggered by transient pulses of magma injection, that last 10-1‚Äì101, years into shallow sill-like reservoirs rather than by volatile exsolution. Magma is then transported from these shallow reservoirs to the eruptive vents by conduits rather than dikes. Aside from the 2008-2009 Chaiten eruption, there is no conclusive geodetic evidence in the SVZ for dike intrusions. In terms of specific volcanoes, I detect precursory inflation for at least 6 years before the Hudson volcano 2011 eruption. I also detect ground deformation during different stages of the eruptive cycle at Villarrica, Llaima, and Calbuco volcanoes, although there is very little evidence of pre-eruptive geodetic signals for these three edifices. Several mechanisms including open conduits, spatiotemporal aliasing and signals below the detection threshold can explain the overall lack of ground deformation. On the other hand, InSAR records an eleven-year cycle of three pulses of pre-eruptive uplift, co-eruptive deflation, and three different pulses of post-eruptive magma recharge at Cordon Caulle volcano. The sources responsible for these transient pulses of deformation are shallow, at depths between 4 and 6 km, and located in different parts of the volcano. I suggest that these magma injection pulses remobilize the melt in the crystal mush that likely underlies the edifice. Further, a unique set of InSAR ground deformation and topographic data recorded during the VEI 4-5 eruption of this volcano between June 2011 and March 2012 provides the first quantitative constraints on the evolution of rhyolitic lava extrusion and the deflation of the reservoir that stored this magma. A physicochemical model forecasts the quasi-exponential trend of ground deflation and lava effusion, and predicts that the reservoir had an H2O content halfway between a gas-rich and a completely degassed rhyolite, consistent with the observed hybrid explosive - effusive eruptive style.		2/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:39Z (GMT).

Especially for small quadcopters, whose velocities are of the same order as those of the velocity fluctuations caused by wind or proximity to obstacles, understanding the effects of turbulence is of vital importance in developing better control and design strategies. To this end, an experiment was designed and conducted in a wind tunnel to systematically analyze the susceptibility of small quadcopter flight to disturbances due to homogeneous turbulence. A framework relating turbulence properties and this susceptibility was developed and compared to experimental results. The initial results are found to agree with this framework, and are used to develop a plan for future experiments.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:40Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

PDT relies on cytotoxic singlet oxygen that is locally generated through energy transfer between a photosensitizer and molecularly dissolved triplet oxygen. To minimize side-effects, i.e. damage of healthy tissue, targeted delivery to places of disease, high local photosensitizer concentrations, high singlet oxygen quantum yield, and rapid post-treatment clearance of photosensitizers are desired. Ultrasmall (sub-10 nm) organic-inorganic hybrid silica nanoparticles loaded with photosensitizer molecules, referred to as silica nanophotosensitizers (SNPSs), present a way to meet these requirements. Here, we investigate two different particle designs of ultrasmall poly(ethylene glycol) coated (PEGylated) SNPSs covalently binding the methylene blue derivate MB2. In the first approach (design one), MB2 is encapsulated into the silica matrix, while in the second approach (design two), MB2 is grafted on the particle surface in between chains of the stabilizing PEG corona. We compare both cases with regard to their singlet oxygen quantum yields, Œ¶Œî, with the effective Œ¶Œîeff per particle reaching 111% and 161% for design one and two, respectively. Finally, we show that both particle designs allow functionalization with a targeting peptide, c(RGDyC), rendering SNPSs a promising platform for medical applications.		2/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:41Z (GMT).

Different from commercial operations‚Äô objective aimed at maximizing profit, the primary objective arising in nonprofit organizations is to fairly satisfy the demand of recipients. Rising demand and limited resource increase the importance of effective food allocation operations that maximize equity and resource utilization at the same time. In the context of food bank operations, we consider the problem of collecting an uncertain quantities of donation and allocating them sequentially to meet customers‚Äô demands that are uncertain until arriving at the customer‚Äôs location. A SRA model is formulated that can be used to design an optimal visiting route; it focus on equity maximization and waste reduction. Without considering travel cost/time restriction, our work solves the problem by developing a new objective function to minimize the filling rate (i.e., the ratio of the allocation quantity to observed demand) gap among agencies. An experimentation is designed to evaluate and analyze the performance of the algorithm, and the proposed method yield better solutions in terms of waste reduction. Furthermore, by using adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS), we extend the model to include travel cost into consideration to find a near-optimal visiting route. A case study with larger scale is also performed that shows the algorithm obtains high-quality solutions in terms of equity and efficiency (travel costs).

The trend has fueled the rise of the widespread coworking phenomenon, referring to a style of work commonly adopted by independent, mobile workers. The objective of this research was three-fold: (1) to understand the importance of physical workplace in motivating people to use the coworking spaces; (2) to evaluate the importance and satisfaction of environmental features; and (3) to generate design toolkit for third places to work in the digital age. As the main methodology, Coworking Space Survey was developed and tested with 75 participants recruited from the current coworking communities. This research has implications for evaluating, creating, or reimagining the third places to work in the new era.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:43Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

High-dimensional data is abundant in contemporary scientific research due to the rapid advances in new data-measurement technologies and computing power. Recent advances in statistics have witnessed great development in the field of high-dimensional data analysis.  This dissertation proposes three methods that study three different components of a general framework of the high-dimensional structured regression problem. A general theme of the proposed methods is that they cast a certain structured regression as a convex optimization problem. In so doing, the theoretical properties of each method can be well studied, and efficient computation are facilitated. Each method is accompanied by thorough theoretical analysis of its performance, and also by an R package containing its practical implementation. We show that the proposed methods perform favorably (both theoretically and practically) compared with pre-existing methods.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:43Z (GMT).

As nosocomial infections are increasingly resistant to multiple antibiotics, first-line treatments often fail. Despite efforts to decontaminate surfaces and high-touch areas in hospitals, inanimate surfaces can still harbor bacteria for hours to months, providing a potential reservoir of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens. Studies have shown that low levels of antibiotics and two common biocides, triclosan and chlorhexidine, can promote horizontal gene transfer. Cleaning hospital surfaces is done to prevent the spread of bacteria, but I hypothesize that this behavior may promote the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes. To test this hypothesis, I first characterize the bacterial communities contaminating hospital surfaces and the potential for transformation of contaminating DNA. I then evaluate the effects of disinfectants on specific bacteria. Finally, I assess the potential of disinfectant induced horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. I hope to better understand how antibiotic resistance genes can be transferred in surface communities in response to disinfectant treatment, and ultimately draw conclusions to inform best hospital cleaning practices.

It is important to understand how black and Latino adults experience and manage diet-related chronic health conditions to develop research, policies and healthcare practices to promote health equity. Chronic illness management experiences are embedded within the social relational context, however the role of social relationships in chronic illness is understudied among minority groups. This research aimed to qualitatively explore how social relationships shape experiences making diet-related behavior changes to manage chronic conditions among minority adults. Two separate, related studies were conducted to understand how participants constructed their experiences with diet-related behavior changes in the context of their social relationships. The first study qualitatively explored how overweight black and Latino adults in a low-income urban setting experienced making diet-related behavior changes in a pilot weight loss intervention. The objective was to explore the feasibility of small eating behavior changes in this population. The second study explored, in the context of a recent diagnosis with type II diabetes, how social relationships shaped black women‚Äôs day-to-day diabetes experiences, how they experienced the effect of diabetes on their social relationships, and how relational experiences changed over a year. Findings of both studies demonstrate the value of investigating social relationships to explore interactors, content, process, and dynamics of health behavior-related interactions in minority populations; some findings stand out. First, diverse and unexpected social network members, such as sister-friends, adult children, and family with diabetes, were identified as salient to diet-related behavior change experiences. Second, participants described actively managing their relationships to selectively assemble desired help, navigate conflict, and preserve relationships while attempting diet-related behavior changes. Third, health behavior-related interactions were described as changeable, particularly through relationship management processes. Findings demonstrate how relational dynamics among black and Latino adults managing diet-related chronic conditions may act as pathways to reinforce and/or disrupt health inequalities. Findings suggest that research and health promotion approaches that consider a variety of network members and mechanics and development of health behavior-related interactions may be important to better understand how relationships shape making changes to manage diet-related chronic health conditions among these underrepresented and at-risk populations.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:45Z (GMT).

Individuals may witness crimes and be called as witnesses; police officers often need to make assessments about whether they or those around them are in danger; and community members may serve as jurors in civil or criminal cases. In each of these contexts, biases in memory and decision making may lead to extreme consequences for the suspects and defendants involved. In this thesis, I present three studies exploring memory and decision making in diverse contexts. In my first paper, I demonstrate that children‚Äôs minimal group membership impacts their memories of actions committed by in- and out-group members across time. In the second paper, I explore two novel interventions aimed at reducing shooting decision inaccuracy in mock police officers. Last, I investigate mock juror decision making as a function of verdict procedure and find that jurors‚Äô decisions are remarkably similar when jurors render a general verdict, or when asked to provide reasons for their decisions before or after rendering a general verdict; however, jurors‚Äô decisions are dissimilar when rendering a special verdict. Implications for the criminal justice system are discussed.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:45Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Implicit communication may bear various forms, from denotative versus connotative phrasal meaning representations to evaluations of holistic or stepwise behaviors (whether among humans or among nodes of a system more broadly) in determination of implicit participation and cooperation. This thesis proceeds in documenting how various communicative channels serve to inform accommodative design receptive to unconventional indicators of participation. It holistically encompasses such explorations through theories of silence and current work in conversational database querying, but the focus in particular is upon research for proof-of-concept game design attending to theory of mind presentations in children with autism spectrum disorder. This project is not only about informing accommodative design, but also about informing the \textit{means} of informing accommodative design; as such, user study and expert feedback sessions not only serve the design process, but the design of the design process. Confronting similar processes and problems whether crafting a working set of linguistic definitions or crafting expectations for free-form querying with small data, the theory-of-mind project is a unifying thread for the whole as a matter of finding, or building, the structures necessary for open-ended communicative liberty. Working to expand technological inclusivity via assumed cooperation, this project and its adjuncts explore how far the limits may be taken of what a system or dataset may offer the user and vice versa for as long as communicative ``benefit of the doubt'' is granted and sustained.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:46Z (GMT).

Both of these industries have specific body figures that they work with: in fashion it is a fit model (intended to represent a range of bodies) and in theatre and film costuming it is an actor (therefore, a design intended for a specific, individual body). Creating custom half scale forms has not been possible due to the limitations in technology for capturing the 3D image of the individual. We now have the ability, with a hand-held scanner, to capture a 3D image of anyone, anywhere.  In this study I worked with several professional experienced cutter/drapers to create patterns with the custom half scale forms and in one case, with a standard full-scale form at the same time.  By documenting the process for each method through journals, photos and observation, a comparison was made between the time and material spent on each. A mixed methods approach was used to analyze the data collected from the study participants. At the end of the study we found a slight time savings when using the custom half scale forms, and we started to collect data on material use. The fit results from the final fitting muslins made from the patterns were mixed, and it became clear that the participants did not trust the custom half scale forms enough to create patterns that fit closely to the form. Based on results from the pilot test, in which inexperienced students fitted their patterns much more closely, we believe that with experience the use of these innovative forms will be able to, in many cases, eliminate the muslin fitting stage from the development of theatrical costumes entirely.

This project presents a process to enhance this early stage design exploration by making it easier and more intuitive to explore a wider range of possibilities. It‚Äôs called V-Sketch. We employ digital computation to translate from intuitive sketching to 3D geometric elements. Unlike earlier work, we decouple the sketch analysis from the creation of the 3D forms allowing for a modular and therefore more flexible representation of the resulting elements. This is accomplished by introducing an intermediary, qualitative description of the sketches. "Sketch analysis" using machine learning techniques is employed to generate this intermediate description of the sketch data as the designer draws. A "reconstruction function" then translates the description into a resulting 3D form. The introduction of a reconstruction function allows an artist or designer to flexibly redefine the solution space of possible 3D forms from the same sketch as they desire without having to retrain the machine learning algorithms. Our methods are focused primarily on architectural design but potentially generalizes to other visual design problems such as, sculpture, virtual environments and industrial design. This thesis presents a conceptual framework for the V-Sketch system. We present the interactive construction of an open source data set of labelled three-dimensional drawing data, and we show a prototype implementation of the system that demonstrates the approach and motivation for the project.

At the same time, algorithms themselves are rapidly evolving, which means that any accelerators designed have to be efficient not just at the algorithms used today, but also at any future algorithms that may be developed. This thesis explores the question, ‚ÄòSurely specialised accelerators have their space in this landscape, but is there a case to be made for an architecture that can provide competitive performance at low power, while remaining highly programmable and future-proof?‚Äô This work tries to answer that question with a ‚ÄòYes‚Äô, presenting VIP (Versatile Inference Processor), a system employing well-understood concepts of vector-processing and near-data processing with some modest, but key modifications that are critical to its performance. Through detailed microarchitecture simulations, it shows that VIP achieves competitive performance on a number of machine learning algorithms such as belief propagation (BP) on Markov random fields (MRFs), and deep neural networks (DNNs) including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Through synthesis of RTL code for a VIP processing engine (PE), it shows that the requirements for VIP are modest ‚Äì VIP‚Äôs 128 PEs require 18 mm2 in area and consume 3.4 W to 4.8 W of power.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:48Z (GMT).

We will explore the results of the RG in two ways.  In the first part we use information geometry, in which the local distance between models measures their distinguishability from data, to quantify the flow of information under the renormalization group. We show that information about relevant parameters is preserved, with distances along relevant directions maintained under flow. By contrast, irrelevant parameters become less distinguishable under the flow, with distances along irrelevant directions contracting according to renormalization group exponents. We develop a covariant formalism to understand the contraction of the model manifold.  We then apply our tools to understand the emergence of the diffusion equation and more general statistical systems described by a free energy.  Our results give an information-theoretic justification of universality in terms of the flow of the model manifold under coarse graining. In the second part, we use dynamical systems theory to systematize the results of the RG. The results of the RG are commonly advertised as the existence of power law singularities near critical points. The classic predictions are often violated and logarithmic and exponential corrections are treated on a case-by-case basis. We use the mathematics of normal form theory to systematically group these into universality families of seemingly unrelated systems united by common scaling variables. We recover and explain the existing literature, predict the nonlinear generalization for universal homogeneous functions, and show that the procedure leads to a better handling of the singularity with several examples including the Random Field Ising model and the 4-d Ising model.  The RG is useful not just for systems in physics but has found application in a surprising variety of fields. In dynamical systems, it provided an nice explanation of the universality observed in the period doubling transition. We show the equivalent of so-called redundant variables in period doubling and offer a new interpretation for them. We then examine the consequences for the Ising model. Finally, the last part of this thesis is on a very different topic. Here, we use an effective Hamiltonian to characterize particle dynamics and find escape rates in a periodically kicked Hamiltonian. We study a model of particles in storage rings that is described by a chaotic symplectic map. Ignoring the resonances, the dynamics typically has a finite region in phase space where it is stable. Inherent noise in the system leads to particle loss from this stable region. The competition of this noise with radiation damping, which increases stability, determines the escape rate. Determining this `aperture' and finding escape rates is therefore an important physical problem. We compare the results of two different perturbation theories and a variational method to estimate this stable region. Including noise, we derive analytical estimates for the steady-state populations (and the resulting beam emittance), for the escape rate in the small damping regime, and compare them with numerical simulations.

I first present a detailed review of the physics of gravitational radiation, and compact binaries in general, which provide the key motivation for detailed exploration of the physical processes and modelling of radiation reaction effects. In particular, extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) are a promising source for current and near-future gravitational wave detectors, and detailed modeling of the resulting waveforms requires a deep understanding of the physics of self interactions. The first project which I present in this dissertation is the first derivation of the second-order self force for scalar and electromagnetic fields in flat spacetime. In the process of developing this derivation, several important mathematical subtleties in the definitions of bulk body parameters emerged, which become important at the same order at which gravitational self force computations are considered. Additionally, this self force is of intrinsic interest for charges accelerated by high-powered lasers and in astrophysical systems. Our derivation lays the ground work for future derivations of high order self force in curved spacetime, which may be important for testing alternative theories of gravity. The second project, which comprises the majority of this dissertation, details the development of a tapestry of approximations for highly accurate simulation of high mass ratio inspirals. Due to the precision requirements for waveform templates important for LISA data analysis, one of the significant goals of self force calculations is to compute waveforms that track the phase of the long evolution of EMRIs to a precision far better than one radian. One of the methods is a multiscale expansion which exploits the separation of scales between the slow radiation-reaction time and the fast orbital time. This dissertation discusses in detail the mathematical techniques of the multiscale approximation method and other approximations in the various regions of the spacetime. The techniques, which I develop in collaboration with √âanna Flanagan, Tanja Hin-derer, and Adam Pound, comprise the only currently available method of assuring sub-radianaccuracy in the computed waveform. The last project presented in this dissertation develops new techniques for quantizing theories which exhibit gauge degrees of freedom. We suggest a modification of the well-known Dirac bracket formalism. The alternative formalism may be more useful than the more frequently used methods of BRST quantization for derivations of local effects of dressed states. In addition, the modified Dirac bracket may be more computationally simple than the original, which may be of use for computations in intricate theories.

The expansion of high-speed railway (HSR) system holds the promise of helping firm entry by reducing the transportation cost and facilitating the flows of human capital and knowledge. In this thesis, I conduct an empirical analysis to quantify the impact of HSR expansion on firm entry in China. The data consists of detailed firm registration data at the county level from 2011 to 2015 and HSR coverage information during the same period. I use the difference-in-differences approach to estimate the impact of HSR expansion on firm entry. I find that the opening of an HSR station in a county increases firm entry in that county by 5.72\% on average and that the impact is larger for high-tech industries. The analysis suggest that the improvement in transportation infrastructure such as the HSR expansion could promote entrepreneurship and further economic growth in China.

For the first, we show the $\Sigma_{2}$ theory of the hyperdegrees as an upper-semilattice is decidable, as is the $\Sigma_{2}$ theory of the hyperdegrees below Kleene's $\mathcal{O}$ as an upper-semilattice with greatest element. These results are related to questions of extensions of embeddings into both structures, i.e., when do embeddings of a structure extend to embeddings of a superstructure. The second part is joint work with Richard Shore and Jun Le Goh. We investigate a theorem of graph theory and find that one formalization is a theorem of hyperarithmetic analysis: the second such example found, as it were, in the wild. This work is ongoing, and more may appear in future publications.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:50Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Specifically, three research aims are proposed. The first aim is developing integrated optimization models for the sustainable design and operations of shale gas energy systems, which covers three detailed projects. In the first related project, we propose an endpoint-oriented life cycle optimization framework to investigate the economic and environmental implications of incorporating modular manufacturing into shale gas supply chains. In the second project, we develop an integrated hybrid life cycle optimization (LCO) model, which enables automatic identification of sustainable alternatives in the design and operations of shale gas supply chains. In the third project, we propose a dynamic MFA-based LCO framework that provides high-fidelity modeling of complex material flow networks with recycling options and enables detailed accounting of time-dependent life cycle material flow profiles. The second aim centers on hedging against uncertainty in the shale gas energy system with special focus on data-driven stochastic optimization approach. In the corresponding project, we address the optimal design and operations of shale gas supply chains under uncertainty of estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). The third aim addresses the modeling and optimization of decentralized shale gas energy systems. We propose a novel game-theory-based stochastic model that integrates two-stage stochastic programming with a single-leader-multiple-follower Stackelberg game scheme for optimizing decentralized supply chains under uncertainty.

For this reason they are well-studied, and the underlying body of work is usually referred to as extreme value theory. The theory often deals with the behavior in the tail of probability distributions or data sets. A key notation is that of heavy-tailed probability distributions. Univariate heavy-tailed distributions exhibit interesting mathematical properties practical for modelling purposes. However, many types of univariate heavy-tailed distributions do not have natural multivariate extensions. Another area of interest in extreme value theory is that of the clustering of extremes in stationary sequences. Inference of cluster sizes tends to be difficult, partly due to the scarcity of data. Clustering also introduces heavy serial dependence in extremal observations, which in turn influences statistical analysis. This thesis seeks to address the aforementioned problems and difficulties. Key contributions include: a multivariate model for a particular class of heavy-tailed distributions, the subexponential distributions, that allows for the approximation of ruin probabilities; a multilevel approach to extremal inference that partially addresses the issue of data scarcity and that improves the variance of extremal estimators; and an algorithmic method to reduce the impact of serial dependence in extremal inference.

For proponents of the movement, food became a critical tool of resistance in response to inequality. For opponents, food was used as a weapon of power to maintain white supremacy and undermine the entire movement. Yet narratives of food are largely absent from civil rights historiography, obscured by struggles for voting rights, integration, and education. Written as three papers, this dissertation shifts the way we understand the historical struggle for civil rights, the contemporary struggle for food justice and food sovereignty, and the politics of food.  The first paper recovers the broader food story of the civil rights era in Mississippi and shows how power and politics obscured key elements of that story at the intersection of gender, class, time, and space. Drawing on a wide range of archival materials, civil rights scholarship, and interviews, I analyze responses to the 1962-1963 Greenwood Food Blockade and examine the work of activists such as Fannie Lou Hamer and L.C. Dorsey to ensure food security among poor blacks in the Delta through efforts such as farm cooperatives and food projects. The second paper situates the concept of food power‚Äîthe use of food as a weapon or an element of power in the global context of politics and national security‚Äîat the center of post-1965 anti-civil rights activism in Mississippi. Led by US Representative Jamie Whitten, Senator John Stennis, and Senator James Eastland, the congressional white power structure ignited a campaign against War on Poverty efforts designed to alleviate poverty and hunger in Mississippi. Such antipoverty efforts, in the context of civil rights throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, threatened the politics of white supremacy. In the third paper, I juxtapose the historical case of Freedom Farms Cooperative in Mississippi and the contemporary case of Rocky Acres Community Farm in Central New York to demonstrate how these cases help us understand relations between historical and contemporary struggles for food justice as a strategy for building emancipatory forms of food power and sustainability.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:52Z (GMT).

Drawing on literature on discrete emotions, mixed emotions, prosocial behaviors, order effects, and emotional flow, this dissertation investigates the role of compassion and anger in prosocial communication from three different angles. Chapter 2 presents two experiments that study compassion and anger as appeals that augment the persuasiveness of messages. Chapter 3 documents an experiment that examines compassion and anger as a dynamic process that develops and evolves during audience‚Äôs message exposure. Chapter 4 reports on an experiment that investigates compassion and anger as incidental cues to and products of messages and examines whether the two functions of emotions work jointly. Overall, this dissertation contributes to the literature in a number of ways. In Chapter 2, it connects victim portrayals with collective action, expands the array of emotions in predicting collective action, and furthers the investigation of collective action in third-party contexts. In Chapter 3, it integrates classic research on order effects with the emerging emotional flow perspective, explores an understudied emotional experience, empathic anger, and provides new insights on the role of emotional intensity in influencing persuasion. In Chapter 4, it explores how incidental and message-induced emotions may or may not interact to influence persuasion and complements existing research on the moderating effect of political ideology regarding environment-related messaging. Practically speaking, this dissertation research offers useful guidance to help researchers and practitioners design more effective messages and communication tools to encourage prosocial behaviors.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:53Z (GMT).

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have shown that most sequence variation linked to disease is located not in protein coding genes but in noncoding sequence. The noncoding genome is known to play important roles in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression, and understanding its function will translate to improved understanding of genetic disease and health outcomes. In this dissertation, I have used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to perturb noncoding regulatory elements at the critical developmental Pitx2 locus to investigate their function in organogenesis and human disease.  		The transcription factor Pitx2 patterns the left-right (LR) embryonic axis and regulates LR asymmetric organogenesis. Loss of left-specific Pitx2 expression is linked to life threatening congenital defects of the heart and intestines. Importantly, mutations affecting noncoding sequence upstream of Pitx2 while leaving the Pitx2 gene intact are associated with Pitx2-mediated disease, suggesting that cis-regulatory elements may regulate Pitx2 expression. Here we have investigated differences in chromatin structure and transcription underlying LR asymmetric organogenesis at the Pitx2 locus. We use transcriptional profiling to identify a novel conserved long noncoding RNA, Playrr, that is expressed asymmetric and complementary to Pitx2 and participates in mutually antagonistic transcriptional regulation with Pitx2.  	In addition to its essential roles in LR organ development, Pitx2 and its genomic locus have been linked to atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common arrhythmia worldwide in humans. Despite multiple GWAS identifying noncoding variants at the Pitx2 locus in association with the most significant genetic contribution to AF risk, the function of these variants and mechanisms by which they may mediate cis-regulation of Pitx2 and AF pathophysiology remain unknown. Here, using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in mice to target the Playrr RNA transcript, I demonstrate that Playrr mutant mice have evidence of pacemaker dysfunction and are predisposed to AF, mirroring arrhythmia phenotypes found in Pitx2 loss-of-function mutants and Pitx2 heterozygous mice, suggesting a relationship between Playrr, Pitx2, and AF. In conclusion, my work uncovers a role for the lncRNA Playrr in arrhythmia and provides multiple novel noncoding mouse models to investigate functions of the cis-regulatory genome and the chromatin level mechanisms in the context of Pitx2-related disease."		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:54Z (GMT).

These issues were particularly salient in early eighteenth-century Britain, as printed texts become more broadly available and affordable, and readers could no longer be relied upon to have a top education and sophisticated tools of analysis. Authors like Fielding and Swift also were experimenting in new forms like the novel that had no standards for analysis. These authors were interested in and concerned about how their work and that of their contemporaries would stand up to future scrutiny. How did the changing economic incentives for writing, from courting wealthy patrons to selling in mass volume to unknown readers, affect literature‚Äôs claim to everlasting value? Pope was the first English author to earn a sustainable living from his writings, but that new economic viability also spawned Grub Street hack writing, not to mention unsavory publishing practices. In this historical context, sustained metaphors of eating and digesting were a playfully denigrating way for these writers to investigate what it meant to write for consumers, even as the metaphors also revivified older literary traditions and genres by incorporating them into modern contexts. The coda includes interpretations of contemporary fecal art pieces "Cloaca" by Wim Delvoye and "Vorm-Fellows-Attitude" by artist collective Gelatin.

Variation in aflatoxin production by Aspergillus flavus is maintained by balancing selection, but the ecological function and impact on fungal fitness of this compound are unknown.  I hypothesize that balancing selection for aflatoxin production in A. flavus is driven by interaction with insects and microbes. To test this, I competed naturally occurring aflatoxigenic and non-aflatoxigenic fungal isolates against drosophila larvae and soil microbes using microcosm experiments. In all microcosms I used quantitative PCR to quantify DNA as a proxy for fitness. I demonstrate that, in the presence of insects, aflatoxigenic isolates have a fitness advantage relative to non-aflatoxigenic isolates. I speculate that this advantage is conferred through interference competition and protection from fungivory. Conversely, I demonstrate that aflatoxigenic isolates have a fitness cost relative to non-aflatoxigenic isolates when competing with soil microbes.  I speculate that this fitness cost is the result of energetic costs associated with aflatoxin production. Using field isolates from two north-south transects spanning the United States, I demonstrate that patterns in the frequency of aflatoxigenic isolates are consistent with selection at a local level. To the best of my knowledge, this work represents the first evidence for possible selective pressures driving balancing selection and the most comprehensive assessment of A. flavus population structure in the United States to date.

In Chapter 1, I highlight the major developments in the research field and identify the overarching themes and motivations. I also provide a roadmap for the rest of the thesis and summarize the main results. The remaining eight chapters contain original studies, organized along three broad motifs. In Chapters 2 through 5, I investigate how the nature of collective excitations and quasiparticles can be explored in modern experiments. More specifically, I model the dynamics of a spin impurity in a Bose lattice gas, develop a protocol for observing fractionalized excitations or anyons in an optical cavity, and characterize the collective dynamics of Bogoliubov quasiparticles and domain walls in a Fermi superfluid. In Chapters 6 and 7, I examine unconventional superfluid phases in spin-imbalanced Fermi gases. In particular, I propose a novel technique for engineering the long-sought-after Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase and study the relative stability of exotic phases across a dimensional crossover. Finally, Chapters 8 and 9 are devoted to studies of kinetics in out-of-equilibrium systems. I model the formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a dimple trap and characterize the approach to thermal equilibrium in quasi-one-dimensional geometries.

The first chapter of this dissertation assesses the impact of smallholders‚Äô participation in a novel business model called the Relationship Coffee Model. The second chapter evaluates the economics and ecology of shade-grown coffee, a production system regarded as environmentally sustainable. The third chapter considers the crucial role of cooperatives, and trust and reciprocity among its members. Overall, chapter one provides evidence of a sustainable business model connecting smallholders with high-value chains and stimulating the use of agro-ecological practices. Chapter two shows that under the appropriate market conditions, smallholders receive benefits from bird and forest conservation, facilitating a sustainable interaction of human and natural systems. Chapter three concludes that propensity to trust and reciprocate among members of the same cooperative is higher but only when the length of membership in the cooperative is considered. Moreover, gender inclusion and education play an important role in improving trust and reciprocity. Taking together, the three chapters suggest that, making coffee a fully sustainable agricultural product is an attractive strategy to overcome the current challenges of the coffee industry globally.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:57Z (GMT).

Here, I show a role for a core spliceosomal factor, Prp8, in balancing splicing speed with fidelity. An RNaseH-like domain (RH) within Prp8 contains a 17 amino acid insertion called the RH extension, which has been demonstrated to exist in two conformations: a Œ≤-hairpin, or an open loop structure. My work demonstrates that these two structures of the RH extension are associated with two distinct functional spliceosomal states. I demonstrate that mutations that increase the relative stability of the open loop conformation result in fast, but error-prone splicing. By contrast, mutations that increase the relative stability of the Œ≤-hairpin conformation result in hyper-accurate, but slow splicing. I propose a model where the RH extension toggles back and forth between the two conformations during splicing and helps balance speed with fidelity.  Further, to better understand the functional role of RH extension in splice site usage, I have investigated its evolution across organisms which display varying levels of degeneracy in their splice site sequences. Remarkably, the RH extension residues are invariant among widely diverged species across almost all domains of eukaryotic life, the vast majority of which have degenerate splice site sequences. By contrast, in several organisms where the amino acid sequence of the RH extension has evolved, splice site sequences are seen to conform to a more rigid consensus, suggesting the fascinating possibility that the RH extension has driven the push towards constricting the splice site sequences present in these organisms.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:46:58Z (GMT).

It is difficult to control the orientations of micron or sub-micron sized specimens when delivered to the X-ray beam. Furthermore, the signals in the snapshots may be so weak that each of them cannot be oriented separately.  This thesis develops algorithms to address the task of 3D reconstruction from unoriented, noisy snapshots, with special focus on two X-ray methods. For the first one, single particle imagining at X-ray free electron lasers, we discuss the difficulty of orientation reconstruction of samples through computer simulation, and then present the analysis results of two experimental datasets. For the second technique, serial microcrystallography at synchrotron storage ring sources, we first describe the development of our reconstruction algorithm through two proof-of-concept studies. In these studies, diffraction patterns were collected from large protein crystals to simulate the signal level of those collected from protein microcrystals at storage ring sources. Finally, we demonstrate our method by solving a protein structure from microcrystal diffraction patterns collected at a storage ring synchrotron source. These data would have been discarded by crystallographers because of their weak signals. Through the detailed presentation of the analysis processes, this thesis is also meant to be a self-contained tutorial on reconstruction problems using X-ray sources.

The thesis investigates the potential of kirigami-folding with the addition of strategically placed cuts at multiple scales through both computational design and physical prototyping. The thesis develops a novel method and workflow for generating two dimensional (2D) kirigami pattern, developed from given doubly curved three dimensional (3D) surface (Inverse process) and simulating the folding motion of kirigami pattern from 2D pattern to 3D goal shape (Forward process). The workflow is based on a reciprocal feedback loop of computational design, finite element analysis, dynamic simulation and physical prototyping. Extended from previous research funded by the National Science Foundation in the Sabin Design Lab at Cornell University titled, eSkin and Kirigami in Architecture, Technology, and Science (KATS), this thesis incorporates materiality into the folding process and successfully develops active kirigami models from DNA scale to human scale. The result presented in the paper provides an attractive method for kirigami design and fabrication with wide range of applications.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:00Z (GMT).

With the wide band gap and high elec- tron mobility, GaN also possesses great potential in power applications. Unlike the traditional wide-band-gap material (SiC) used in power applications, GaN has a strong polarization effect, which enables dopant-free doping techniques that can realize two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) as well as three-dimensional (3D) bulk doping. This work focuses on exploring polarization doping for power applications. GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), which are based on the polarization-induced 2DEG, have already been well researched for power applications. The highest reported breakdown voltage of GaN HEMTs is as high as ‚àº3000 V. How- ever, the performance of 2DEG based diodes are lagging behind. A GaN 2DEG based Schottky barrier diode with a record-breaking breakdown voltage of 1.9 kV is developed and described in this work. The fabrication process of this diode is fully compatible with GaN HEMT fabrication. Thus the diode can be readily integrated with GaN HEMTs. In contrast to the polarization-induced 2DEG, the polarization-induced 3D bulk dop- ing is rarely studied for power applications. Here we start by studying the electron mo- bility in polarization-doped Al x Ga 1-x N with a low doping concentration of ‚àº1 √ó 10 17 cm ‚àí3 . The electron mobility is first experimentally extracted. Then a theoretical model of the electron mobility is built based on the experimental data. The theoretical model reveals that as the doping concentration is further reduced, it is crucial to reduce dislo- cation density and thus its adverse effect on the electron mobility. Both polarization-induced 2DEG and bulk doping are then applied to a GaN metal- oxide-semiconductor HEMT (MOSHEMT) with a polarization-doped p-type back bar- rier. This device, referred to as PolarMOSH is an integral component for the power transistor, referred to as PolarMOS. The successful demonstration of PolarMOSH paves the way towards realizing PolarMOS and eventually taking full advantage of polariza- tion doping in power applications.

In the first chapter, I estimate the effect of education spending on district-level student outcomes in 24 states by leveraging changes in revenue driven by property value variation. I interact state-level changes in property values with fixed school finance formulas that measure how state aid and local revenue respond to those changes to create a simulated instrument for school spending. I measure a leave-one-out mean change in property values for school districts with administrative data I compiled from individual states on property values for over 7,000 school districts. The instrument is highly predictive of changes in revenue and spending. My estimates suggest that a 10 percent increase in spending improves graduation rates by 2.1 to 4.4 percentage points and student test scores by 0.05 to 0.09 standard deviations. These results suggest that market variation in property values affects student outcomes through existing school finance formulas. The second chapter documents the existence and magnitude of an intergenerational effect of cigarette taxes on smoking initiation, which flows from older to younger members of the community. We estimate a discrete-time hazard model with cigarette taxes from before an individual is at risk of beginning smoking (from birth to age seven). A $0.25 increase in cigarette taxes during childhood decreases the hazard of later initiating smoking by 12.5 percent. We find no evidence that contemporaneous cigarette taxes affect smoking initiation. Prior work understates the effect of cigarette taxes on smoking by not considering this intergenerational channel. The final chapter explores whether increased resources for traditional public school districts helps stem the flow of students to charter schools in Ohio. To do this, we separately examine the impact of school resource expansions for capital projects and those for general purposes (current operating expenses, instructional expenditures, support services, etc.) on the fraction of potential traditional public school students attending a charter school, student outcomes, and housing values. Both types of resource expansion reduce the fraction of potential students attending digital charters but have no effect on students lost to brick-and-mortar charters or student achievement.

The overall objective of this research was to assess the food web implications of DCM across a productivity gradient, using the Laurentian Great Lakes as a case study. First, I investigated the driving mechanisms of DCM formation and dissipation in Lake Ontario during April‚ÄìSeptember 2013 using in situ profile data and phytoplankton community structure. Results indicate that in situ growth was important for DCM formation in early- to mid-summer but settling and photoadaptation contributed to maintenance of the DCM late in the stratified season. Second, I expanded my analysis to all five of the Great Lakes using a time series generated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) long-term monitoring program in August from 1996-2017. The cross-lake comparison showed that DCM were closely aligned with deep biomass maxima (DBM) and dissolved oxygen saturation maxima (DOmax) in meso-oligotrophic waters (eastern Lake Erie and Lake Ontario), suggesting that DCM are productive features. In oligotrophic to ultra-oligotrophic waters (Lakes Michigan, Huron, Superior), however, DCM were deeper than the DBM and DOmax, indicating that photoadaptation was of considerable importance. Across lakes, euphotic depth was a significant predictor of both DCM depth and chlorophyll concentration, with greater water clarity associated with deeper and weaker DCM. Lastly, I investigated how DCM formation affects zooplankton diel vertical migration (DVM) by comparing the diel movements of different zooplankton size groups across three transects in southern Lake Michigan during summer 2015. Using taxonomy data from stratified net tows to inform our interpretation of laser optical plankton (LOPC) data, I concluded that phytoplankton distributions are an important determinant of zooplankton weighted mean depth. Trade-offs between optimal temperature, access to food resources, and predator avoidance contributed to differences in DVM among zooplankton size groups and regions of the lake. Overall, DCM production likely contributes significantly to phytoplankton biomass in oligotrophic lakes, causing selection pressure toward cold-adapted zooplankton that can effectively utilize DCM resources.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:03Z (GMT).

In order to perform tasks autonomously in unknown environments, active perception and planning algorithms are required that can leverage their adaptive capabilities. This work presents several such perception and planning tools. An novel, probabilistic object reconstruction algorithm is presented that allows a generic mobile robot (such as a modular robot) intelligently position a 3D sensor to explore unknown objects in its environment. Then, it presents fully autonomous, perception-informed systems for modular self-reconfigurable robots (MSRRs) that enable them to explore, dynamically adapt to their environment, and even augment their environment to perform high-level tasks. Finally, it presents an end-to-end path planning framework for MSRR systems that enables them to reconfigure between multiple morphologies and use multiple gaits in order to traverse and plan optimal paths over challenging terrain.

Considering that the very foundational myth of Mexican history involves a pilgrimage‚Äîthe sacred journey that the people of Aztl√°n undertake in search of a sacred vision: an eagle perched on a prickly pear cactus, devouring a snake‚Äî, I have devoted my research to the study of this peculiar form of sacred travel. Indeed, my investigation demonstrates that sacred journeys allow pilgrims to cross "sacred" borders and enter mystical territories. Moreover, in the texts I study, pilgrimages facilitate reencounters with lost identities and with distant temporalities and, through these reencounters, they offer the promise of spiritual (and even physical) resurrections. The pilgrims I examine embark on sacred journeys to descend (or to ascend) into the social and existential depths (or summits) of the flesh and mind; through their journeys, these pilgrims discover unique sanctuaries: mirrors of degenerate eroticism, of terminal sickness, of folk sanctity, and of supernatural healing. Pilgrimages, I argue, entail the delirious search for the eternal in the realm of the ephemeral, for the immortal in the mortal, for the miraculous in the mundane. The first chapter of my dissertation explores a canonical short story: "Talpa", by Juan Rulfo. I argue that this story masterfully employs the semantics and syntax of two of the most important constituents of pilgrimage: the idea of miracle and that of penitence. "Talpa" uses the miraculous to meditate on (and to refute) a commonplace associated not only with Mexican literature, but with Latin American literature in general: lo maravilloso (the marvelous). Moreover, this story uses the penitential to illustrate another of the pillars of pilgrimage: an economy of exchange between the divine and the human. I also demonstrate that "Talpa" reveals pilgrimage‚Äôs theatrical nature; indeed, in Juan Rulfo‚Äôs story, two pilgrimages fight with each other: one is real, whereas the other one is fictional: a performance which suddenly becomes murderous. In my second chapter, I examine the film Bajo California: El l√≠mite del tiempo, by Carlos Bolado. I focus my analysis on the sui generis pilgrimage of the main character (Dami√°n Ojeda, a Latino artist) who crosses the Mexico-U.S border to expiate the guilt he feels after running over a pregnant woman. His pilgrimage takes place "backwards"; that is, he crosses from the U.S into Mexico: from the Global North into the Global South, an itinerary that subverts the conventional geopolitics of (in)migration. I also argue that in Bajo pilgrimage disguises itself as an artistic installation, an almost sacrilegious operation that abolishes the fallacious divorce between art and religion trumpeted by the architects of modernity. I contend that this film‚Äôs pilgrim returns to the land of his ancestors in search of psychological and spiritual healing; thus, for him the past is his sanctuary. Moreover, Bajo illustrates what I call the heart of pilgrimage: Motherhood. Indeed, all the pilgrimages that my dissertation studies, no matter what "mask" they adopt, are always sacred attempts to return to the maternal womb. Motherhood, this chapter allows me to conclude, is the magnetic force that orchestrates all pilgrimages. In my third chapter, I study Yuri Herrera‚Äôs novel Se√±ales que preceder√°n el fin del mundo (Signs Preceding the End of the World). I concentrate on how this novel uses pilgrimage to illustrate the transculturation of the protagonist, a girl named Makina, who embarks on a journey to the U.S. in search of her lost brother. Furthermore, in this chapter I prove that pilgrimage demands a transcultural space: one where different historical periods and nations interact: in Bajo‚Äôs pilgrimage, elements of the Pre-Columbian world dialogue with those of the Latinx world, and contemporary Greater Mexico is in dialogue with its colonial past. Finally, in my last chapter, I analyze the construction of secular sanctity through a series of pilgrimages in The Hummingbird‚Äôs Daughter, a novel by Latino writer Luis Alberto Urrea. I understand The Hummingbird‚Äôs as a series of metamorphosis: an illegitimate girl becomes a pilgrim, and later becomes a saint, and finally becomes a migrant. Her ontological trajectory starts in the telluric, enters the divine, and finally returns to the telluric. In this fictional hagiography, migration and pilgrimage become the same indivisible substance.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:04Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Turritellid gastropods are a Jurassic-Recent group of marine snails, with ~140 valid, named living species and ~800 valid fossil species. They are often the dominant macrofaunal in assemblages in which they occur, and are important for biostratigraphy and paleoclimatology. The unusual morphologies investigated in this study are uncoiling, occurring in the Vermicularia, and septation, which has been considered characteristic of the family Turritellidae, but unusual among gastropods as a whole. In chapter one, I construct a global molecular phylogeny for turritellids. Turritellids have notoriously simple shells, inhibiting understanding of supraspecific relationships among species and the widespread adoption of most proposed generic names. We constructed a molecular phylogeny of more than 30 species from a globally distributed dataset based on the 12S and 16S mitochondrial and nuclear H3 regions. Several distinct clades were recovered, with molecular distances indicating divergence times were likely older than the Miocene. A generic revision is proposed. In chapter two, I construct both molecular and morphological trees for fossil and Recent members of the Miocene-Recent group Vermicularia (Cerithioidea: Turritellidae). We provide a revised taxonomy with more detailed diagnoses for all known living and fossil species. A new species is described from the early Pliocene from the Dominican Republic. In chapter three, I examine the evolution of the Vermicularia in an evolutionary developmental biology framework. Isotopic sclerochronology was used to determine growth patterns and rates in both fossil and Recent species within the phylogenetic framework established in chapter two. This ontogenetic information allows study of the specific heterochronic mechanisms involved in the origin of these species‚Äô morphologies. In chapter four, I demonstrate that septation in turritellids is not an anomaly, but is a widespread feature of high-spired gastropods. Adaptive hypotheses for turritellid septation do not survive strong scrutiny. I outline a methodology for testing the hypothesis that a feature originated as a spandrel, rather than the direct product of selection for that feature. I conclude that septa within turritellids are spandrels of shell thickening, rather than being adaptive themselves.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:05Z (GMT).

This thesis is devoted to understanding how gravitational interactions in different astrophysical situations effect the structure and dynamical evolution of protoplanetary disks, shaping the planetary systems the disks give birth to.  Chapter 2 shows how disk warping in a hydrodynamical disk torqued by a spinning central star and inclined binary companion affects the disk's structure and drives its long-term evolution.  Chapter 3 looks at how photoevaporation and the formation of a massive, short-period planet modifies the excitation between the spin-axis of a spinning oblate star and angular momentum axis of a protoplanetary disk generated by the gravitational torque from an inclined binary companion.  Chapter 4 derives the conditions a protoplanetary disk must satisfy to undergo the Lidov-Kozai instability, where the disk's eccentricity grows from the gravitational torque exerted on the disk by an inclined binary companion.  Chapter 5 derives the conditions a protoplanetary disk around an eccentric binary must satisfy to evolve into an orientation perpendicular to the binary's orbital plane (polar alignment).  Chapter 6 shows an extended circumplanetary disk can remain stably tilted out of the planet's orbital plane, provided the torques from the oblate planet and disk self-gravity are sufficiently strong to resist the tidal torque from the planet's host star.  The appendix derives a useful dispersion relation for density waves in a viscous, non-Keplerian disk.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:06Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This 2D stretching of the polymer brushes gives them unique physical properties different from traditional polymer melts. Tuning of the brush configuration, especially at the nanoscale could make polymer brushes a useful functional coating in the fields like anti-fouling and lubrication which counted on their behavior at highly confined regime. Upon removal of lateral confinement through patterning, they would have quite rich response in terms of mechanical, physical properties that are distinct to their non-patterned form for the reduction of the lateral pressure. In short, the foundation of this materials then depends on the ability to harness such transition between 2D to 3D stretching which is the key for the development of advanced materials and devices for biotechnology and electronic/optical applications. In this work, we look forward to increasing the understanding in patterned polymer brushes and it started from the neutral polymer brushes. Brush nanopatterning was conducted using orthogonal process following either top-down or bottom-up approaches with patterned lines as small as 200 nm. The pattern morphology depends not only on the wetting properties of the areas adjacent to the pattern, but also on process history to which the sample has been exposed, especially related to solvent quality. Furthermore, we demonstrated the method to control crosslinking on the edges of the pattern and this leads to the non-ordinary stimuli-responsive behavior. Subsequently, the stability of non-patterned and nanostructured strong polyelectrolyte brushes is studied as a function of both brush character and the properties of a contacting liquid. Nanopatterned polymer brushes proved its value in showing that the chain dynamic is also a dominant factor in brush degrafting and it should also be considered besides the reaction kinetics. The finding inspired us to design polymer brushes with more complex configuration. To characterize them, we fabricated optical grating which has polymer brushes anchoring only on the sidewall. Such platform when working with neutral scattering should allow the reconstitution of the 3D brush profile provide more insight to complicated behavior. The knowledge obtained was also expanded horizontally to the two different fields. For liquid crystal elastomer patterning, it managed to create micro-objects with controlled actuation motion by simply changing the direction of the patterns. On the other hand, polyelectrolyte brushes found its application in the field of biophysics where it could act as a cushion to facilitate the spontaneous formation of the supported lipid bilayer with high transmembrane protein mobility.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:06Z (GMT).

For the past 40 years, Moore‚Äôs Law and Dennard‚Äôs Scaling have provided the smaller, cheaper, faster, and more power-efficient transistors that fueled innovation in computer architecture. In the mid 2000s, Dennard‚Äôs Scaling broke down, and this in turn stagnated the growth in processor clock frequencies and reduced the power efficiency of transistors. More recently, there has been empirical evidence suggesting Moore‚Äôs Law of transistor cost-scaling has slowed down. While transistors continue to shrink at a slower pace, technology scaling is no longer ensuring cheaper, faster, and more power-efficient transistors. In this disruptive regime, architects have a critical role in improving performance while mitigating design costs. The challenges posed by the impending end of Moore‚Äôs Law and the non-existent benefits of Dennard‚Äôs Scaling motivate reconsidering the traditional boundaries between hardware and software. Architects have responded by embracing parallelization and specialization across the layers of the computing stack. A key research challenge involves creating clean hardware/software abstractions that are highly programmable, yet still enable efficient execution on both traditional and specialized microarchitectures. In this thesis, I present a lane-based hardware specialization approach to building programmable accelerators for loop- and fork-join-centric parallel programs. To mitigate the design costs and in- crease the applicability of hardware specialization, I make the case for lane-based behavior-specific accelerators. I propose two lane-based behavior-specific accelerators: XLOOPS and SSAs. Explicit loop specialization (XLOOPS) is an approach that is based on the idea of elegantly encoding inter-iteration dependence patterns in the instruction set. The XLOOPS binaries can execute on (1) traditional microarchitectures with minimal performance impact, (2) specialized microarchitectures to improve performance and/or energy efficiency, and (3) adaptive microarchitectures that can seamlessly migrate loops between traditional and specialized execution to trade-off performance vs. energy efficiency. Smart sharing architectures (SSAs) are a new approach to building lane-based accelerators that can efficiently execute recursive fork-join-centric parallel programs. SSAs designs share expensive hardware resources to reduce the area costs and employ complexity- effective smart sharing mechanisms that exploit instruction redundancy to mitigate the loss in performance while maximizing efficiency.

He also created the largest known body of work by a single author to come from this tradition (thirty-five plays across nearly thirty years), and the author of most of the surviving plays from this area and period that deal with economic themes.  My original contribution to research on this body of work ‚Äì as well as our knowledge of witness accounts of the early Renaissance economy in northern Europe ‚Äì is a conception of Everaert‚Äôs eight "economic plays" as part of one complete narrative of the decline and fall of the economy in his hometown of Bruges, which sunk into a deep depression at the turn of the sixteenth century from which it did not recover for decades.  The plays form an aborted redemptive arc in which the market of Bruges is corrupted and then continually blocked from recovery by the unvirtuous choices of its participants, played out in a drama of acting and reacting.  They reflect a layman‚Äôs understanding of the economy and the forces that drove it, which instructs their author‚Äôs middle-class audience on how to use the market to pursue their own advantages while also fulfilling their obligations to the broader community.  Outside of the analysis of these eight plays, I have also translated them into English in order to enable their broader study and potential performance; this will be the first readily available English translation of any group of Everaert‚Äôs plays.

This is particularly challenging in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) domain where strong and characteristic molecular absorption occurs but optical sources are still in full development. In the past decade, there has been a remarkable development of a miniaturized optical frequency comb source using parametric nonlinear interactions in microresonators. Such integrated devices present as unique tools for direct generation of broadband mid-IR light and ultrafast acquisition speed of molecular absorption information. In this thesis, we address the microresonator technology for the generation of a broadband modelocked frequency comb in the mid-IR. The properties of such microcombs can be precisely controlled, tuned, and characterized. We show that microresonator-based combs is not only an ideal testbed for studying a variety of nonlinear dynamics but, more importantly, can be used to realize a silicon-based platform for vibrational spectroscopy. We demonstrate two different types of mid-IR microcomb-based spectroscopy, dual-comb spectroscopy, and scanning comb spectroscopy which are suitable for condensed phase study and trace gas sensing, respectively.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:08Z (GMT).

In the first chapter, I argue that extant accounts of functions have foundered on a problem I dub the Dysfunction Dilemma, and I offer a way to move forward. Functions are of philosophical interest because the concept plays an important explanatory role in biology, and other sciences, but is apparently teleological and normative ‚Äìan item‚Äôs function is its end, purpose, or goal, and a dysfunctional item is one that fails to realize a particular norm, performance of its proper function. Extant accounts of function do not successfully capture both its explanatory import and its normative and teleological character, either painting dysfunction as conceptually incoherent or painting functions as epiphenomenal.     I diagnose the source of the dilemma and offer an account of functional explanation which avoids it. In the second chapter, I defend the idea that genes, like words or concepts, have intentionality or representational/semantic content. First, I argue that while the standard motivation for this idea is mechanistic analogies between molecular mechanisms and digital computation, Ernst Mayr, one of the architects of the modern synthesis in biology, has provided an alternative and more defensible justification for taking the idea seriously. Parallel to the standard case for representational and computational theories of cognition, Mayr‚Äôs justification rests on the need to invoke representations to explain end-directed processes.  I then put Mayr‚Äôs argument to work answering three kinds of objection to the idea that genes are representational: 1) Genetic representations are causally or explanatorily inert, 2) Genetic processes are too complex and context sensitive to be captured by representational concepts, and 3) Details of molecular biology undermine representational conceptions of genes.  In the final chapter, I develop a historical and philosophical interpretation of Ernst Mayr‚Äôs distinction between proximate and ultimate causes and its relation to Niko Tinbergen‚Äôs "four questions." Both frameworks have been influential in the biological study of behavior and are typically presented as a single framework, with Mayr‚Äôs proximate-ultimate distinction corresponding to one of two axes dividing Tinbergen‚Äôs four questions. I argue that this interpretation misrepresents Mayr‚Äôs and Tinbergen‚Äôs philosophical positions. I offer a positive account of both frameworks and their relation to one another, and I argue that contrary to many critics, Mayr‚Äôs proximate-ultimate distinction, when properly interpreted, does not present a barrier to the project of integrating biological work on Tinbergen‚Äôs four questions.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:09Z (GMT).

Routes of contamination for dairy spoilage organisms include presence in raw materials and survival during processing (generally Gram-positive sporeformers) and post-processing contamination (caused by Gram-negative bacteria, yeast and molds). Given the multiple contamination pathways across the dairy processing continuum, a holistic approach is required to address dairy spoilage. To identify, predict, and prevent dairy spoilage, the studies reported here focused on (i) the application of modern molecular approaches to understand the types of fungi in dairy products and facilitate source tracking along the processing continuum in a standardized method, (ii) the development of a stochastic model and a challenge study protocol to allow industry to better evaluate spoilage control strategies for post-pasteurization fungal contamination and assess the value of these strategies quantitatively, and (iii) the development of a stochastic model to understand the effect of sporeformer contamination over the entire processing continuum and quantitatively assess the effect of spoilage control strategies. Our data revealed that dairy-relevant fungi represent a broad diversity over multiple phyla. Molecular subtyping approaches, namely ITS sequencing, are a useful tool for fungal identification. Moreover, we demonstrated that ITS sequencing can be used for fungal contamination source tracking along the processing continuum, especially for over-represented subtypes. In our stochastic model based on mold post-pasteurization contamination of yogurt, we estimated consumer exposure to visible mold based on a proof-of-concept approach using air plate samples to estimate initial mold contamination rates. This model estimated that 550 +/- 25.2 consumers would be exposed to visible mold growth for every 1 million cups of yogurt produced when no fungal inhibitor was used in the yogurt formulation. Our challenge study protocol developed a method for industry to better evaluate novel spoilage control strategies, such as protective cultures, and revealed that the two protective cultures we evaluated retarded mold, but not yeast growth in Greek yogurt. Finally, our second stochastic model provided a way to model spoilage due to psychrotolerant sporeformers in fluid milk throughout the processing continuum, from the dairy farm to the end of shelf-life and predicted that the mean concentration of psychrotolerant sporeformers in fluid milk at 21 days of storage at 6C is 4.54 +/- 1.71 Log10CFU/mL. Our model also revealed ways to quantitatively assess intervention strategies (e.g., microfiltration) to reduce dairy spoilage through the use of what-if scenarios. Overall, these studies broaden our understanding of dairy spoilage organisms. The combination of molecular subtyping and stochastic modeling represents powerful tools the dairy industry can adopt to (i) achieve more accurate estimates of product spoilage and (ii) tailor spoilage control strategies based on data-driven evidence, thus providing a roadmap to reduce microbial spoilage of dairy products.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:10Z (GMT).

Both electrochemical and physical studies were conducted in ex-situ and in-situ environments. Most of the studies were conducted on novel AAEM materials provided by collaborators of the Coates group at Cornell University.  Both ammonium and phosphonium functionalized AAEMs were studied. Studies address anion exchange dynamics and swelling of the AAEMs using the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) technique.  Acoustic impedance analysis was utilized to understand the viscoelasticity of the membrane material.  The subsequent studies explore the transport properties under different conditions and making use of different electrocatalysts that have shown promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Lastly, the morphology of the AAEMs was studied using transmission electron microscopy, small angle  x-ray scattering (SAXS) and conducting probe atomic force microscopy (Cp-AFM).  In an attempt to uncover the morphology of the AAEMs, the visual formation of carbonate formation was visualized using the insitu-TEM technique.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:11Z (GMT).

Iron Folic Acid tablets are often distributed to pregnant women to address iron deficiency, however, recent data show a high prevalence of anemia within non-pregnant women too. Fortification powders have been found to improve child and maternal health in developing countries. The purpose of this paper, however, is to evaluate possibility of voluntary purchase of fortification powders by households when marketed by local women self-help groups at a price mutually agreed upon by the community. The paper tracks purchasing behavior of 5600 households across 15 villages in rural India for a period of close to 2 years and finds that the likelihood of a household making purchases increases by 55% because of its connectivity to local self help groups and other social networks, while other factors have no bearing at all.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:13Z (GMT).

Baird, Barbara Ann||Estroff, Lara A.	2018-10-22T18:47:12Z			8/30/18		Optical properties of nano-sized materials (optical nanomaterials) can either be the result of interactions of light with periodic material structures, e.g. in colloidal or block copolymer based photonic crystals, or stem from the incorporation of photoactive molecules into nano-sized, optically inactive materials, e.g. fluorescent dyes in organic-inorganic hybrid silica nanoparticles. This dissertation introduces representatives of both material classes. The first case described here are ultrasmall (sub-10 nm) amorphous silica nanoparticles (SNPs) covalently encapsulating photoactive organic moieties. Such particles, referred to as Cornell prime dots (C‚Äô dots), have already shown tremendous success in the safe diagnosis of cancer in human clinical trials with melanoma patients. However, their full potential in the lab and clinical setting, as diagnostic as well as therapeutic probes, has not yet been fully explored. Furthermore, comprehensive understanding of particle structure-property correlations, i.e. core and surface properties, remains limited. In the first part of this dissertation, a new approach for characterizing the particles is introduced using a combination of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), single particle bleaching, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). It is shown that the net charge of organic dyes introduced in the synthesis is a main contributor to chemical surface heterogeneities of the particles. In the second part of this thesis a new class of ultrasmall theranostic silica nanoparticles for the application in photodynamic therapy is described. It is demonstrated that high effective singlet oxygen quantum yields can be achieved, while keeping particle size below the threshold for renal clearance (sub-10 nm). Next, the concept of particle molecular photo-engineering (PMPE) is introduced as a means to tailor photophysical properties of organic dye encapsulating SNPs. By precisely engineering the chemical composition of the amorphous silica particle core network around encapsulated organic dyes using specific functional groups, i.e. mercaptopropyl or iodopropyl groups, dye transient dark states can be controlled which in turn enables super-resolution microscopy and substantially enhanced singlet oxygen quantum yields, respectively. The second class of optical nanomaterials in this dissertation is a self-assembled poly(styrene-block-tert-butyl methacrylate) (StB) diblock copolymer with a photonically active lamellar structure. Bottom-up self-assembly processes provide highly desired and cost-effective methods for the fabrication of large scale/area photonic coatings, making such materials interesting candidates for applications in architecture and design. In part three of this thesis the synthesis of ultralarge molar mass StB block copolymers and their application as iridescent and transparent thin film coatings is described. Development of a casting-lamination process to apply such coatings to window panels allowed the first architectural use of block copolymers as an iridescent fa√ßade in the form of the art installation A needle woman: Galaxy Was a Memory, Earth is a Souvenir by artist Kimsooja. Quantitative characterization of structural as well as optical properties of these coatings establishes that the block copolymer films behave as volume-phase gratings with grating periodicities close to 300 nm.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:12Z (GMT).

Low-mode internal tides are known to transport large amounts of energy throughout the oceans. One possible mechanism, among others, through which the energy of the particular tidal waves can be directly dissipated, without transfer to higher modes, is through wave-BBL interactions, where strong near-bottom shear layers develop, leading to localized instabilities and ultimately mixing. In the model problem, the stability response of the time-dependent wave-induced BBL is examined by introducing low-amplitude perturbations near the bed. For the linear stage of instability evolution, the time-dependent perturbation energy growth rates are computed by tracking the largest perturbation energy density in the domain through the wave-modulated shear and stratification, ultimately the formation of distinct localized near-bed Kelvin Helmholtz billows are observed. The average growth rate, &sigma;, is then compared to the time, T<sub>w</sub> , that a parcel of fluid is subject to a local Richardson number less than 1/4, resulting in a nondimensional criterion for instability, &sigma; T<sub>w</sub>. A stability boundary is then constructed as a function of the three non-dimensional parameters that characterize the flow, the wave steepness, aspect ratio and Reynolds number. It is shown that the nondimensional growth rate can be written as a function of these parameter, &sigma; T<sub>w</sub> = F( Re, st, AR). Additionally the minimum initial perturbation amplitude that is shown to cause overturning of isodensity surfaces for each parameter set is also shown to be a function of the wave parameters, A<sub>c</sub> =  F( Re, st, AR). </p>			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:14Z (GMT).

Examples include quadrature phase generation in image reject receivers, high data rate sampling circuits, clock distribution networks, novel associative memory paradigms and phased array systems for beam scanning. In this work, we study the nonlinear dynamics of coupled oscillators from the perspective of both an applied mathematician who would prefer general and abstract models, and also that of an RF circuit designer who would appreciate comprehensive models that capture more subtle details of such systems. We then explain how the nonlinear phase dynamics of a ring of unidirectionally coupled oscillators may be used for mode switching and frequency tuning and present experimental verication of our analysis with a 65nm CMOS prototype chip. We also present a novel way of controlling relative phases of coupled oscillators by using the naturally occurring phases within oscillator cores to generate arbitrary phase shifts between them. Measurement results for a prototype chip fabricated in a standard 130nm CMOS technology veries the theory and paves the way for employing it in the various applications mentioned before and in particular, beamforming at mmwave frequencies. We also study the pattern recognition applications of coupled oscillator networks and propose a new alternative that avoids the impractical all to all coupling between the oscillators. The compact layout and simplicity of our proposed structure makes it readily implementable in any standard CMOS technology to realize a physical pattern classication system with ultra fast processing speed.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:14Z (GMT).

This results in the dissociation of transducin into its component GTP-bound Œ± subunit and the Œ≤Œ≥ subunit complex. Structural information for the rhodopsin-transducin complex will be essential for understanding the molecular mechanism of visual photo-transduction. Moreover, it will shed light on how GPCRs selectively couple to and activate their G protein signaling partners. I have purified a stable detergent-solubilized complex between rhodopsin and transducin. The complex was formed on native rod outer segment membranes upon light activation, solubilized in lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG) detergent, and purified with a combination of affinity and size exclusion chromatography. The complex is fully functional, with the stoichiometry of rhodopsin to transducin being 1:1. The molecular weight of the complex was calculated from small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data and is in good agreement with a model consisting of one rhodopsin molecule and one transducin molecule. The complex was visualized by negative-stain electron microscopy (EM), which revealed an overall architecture similar to that of the Œ≤2 adrenergic receptor-GS complex including a flexible helical domain in the transducin Œ± subunit. The monodispersity, stability, and high yield of the purified complex allowed for further efforts toward obtaining a high-resolution structure of this important signaling complex. Recent X-ray and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of complexes between different GPCRs and the stimulatory GS protein have revealed how these receptors converge structurally at the cytoplasmic end and engage the same GS protein, whereas, the cryo-EM structures of two GPCR-Gi protein complexes show how the inhibitory Gi protein binds receptors in a different manner than the GS protein. In order to further our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the specificity of GPCR-G protein interactions, and how they result in the G protein activation event, we determined a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the light-activated, native bovine rhodopsin complexed with its cognate G protein partner transducin, which belongs to the inhibitory Gi family. The outward movement of transmembrane helix (TM) 6 and the rearrangement of TM5 at the intracellular side of Rho open up a binding cleft for the transducin Œ± subunit, which engages rhodopsin in a different orientation than previously observed in other GPCR-GS protein complexes. The orientation of GT is also different from that of the Gi protein in the recently reported GPCR-Gi complexes, revealing the unexpected diversity regarding how GPCRs engage their G protein partners, even within the same G protein family. Moreover, the helical domain of the GŒ±T subunit is less flexible than those resolved in previous GPCR-G protein complex structures and adopts an open conformation contacting the transducin Œ≤ subunit, thus shedding new light on its involvement in the G protein activation event.

Wethington, Elaine	2018-10-22T18:47:16Z			8/30/18		The "paradox of aging" is a term coined by researchers to label the counterintuitive phenomenon that older adults maintain high levels of subjective well-being in spite of considerable decrements in objective health status. The present study extended the literature on this phenomenon to Asian contexts by examining age trajectories of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and objective health in a large and nationally representative sample of Taiwanese participants (n = 3,856) aged 55 and older. We found divergent cross-sectional age trajectories for objective health (sensory and physical functioning) as well physical (PCS) and mental components (MCS) of HRQoL (as assessed with the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey; SF-12). Both PCS and objective health were negatively associated with age, but this effect was weaker for PCS. MCS, in turn, showed a positive association with chronological age. Consistent with prior research on the paradox of aging, the association between objective health and PCS became weaker with age. For MCS, associations with objective health did not vary by age, and controlling for objective health strengthened the observed positive association between MCS and age. These findings add to prior evidence indicating that‚Äîin spite of objective health decrements‚Äîsubjective HRQoL is maintained in later life. However, these patterns appear to vary for mental and physical components of HRQoL, and future research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:16Z (GMT).

Such damage detection can be effected through non-destructive means that employ the updating of a physics model describing the system of interest. The resulting inverse problem is concerned with locating and characterizing the damage, by considering the structural dynamic response, before and after the onset of damage. Such model-based approaches also afford prognosis potential, as a calibrated physics model is subsequently available for the damaged system. In this work, a partitioned fluid-structure forward modeling capability is developed from combining an open source CFD tool (OpenFOAM) with an open source CSD solver (CU-BEN) in a tightly coupled framework that affords stable solutions. However, such high fidelity, coupled-physics forward modeling is prohibitive for use in solving model-based inverse problems where the forward model must be called repeatedly, necessitating the consideration of reduced-order modeling methods. Within the context of inversion, the high-fidelity FSI forward model is evaluated on a series of physically inspired "damaged" states to create an offline parametrized library of modeled damaged responses. These responses are expressed in compressed form through empirical eigen-functions, obtained via proper orthogonal decomposition, and subsequently represented as points on a certain Riemannian manifold. From this offline library of reduced-order responses from the fluid-structure interaction model, a proxy model is constructed through manifold interpolation on the nonlinear Riemannian manifold to consider variations on our parameter of interest not explicitly contained within the library, but required as a complete part of the inversion. This subsequent online inversion is effected as a non-convex optimization problem, employing a genetic algorithm to arrive at a plausible reduced order model instance that conforms to observations within some prescribed limits. The robustness of this framework is examined on an example problem, with exploration into the effects of management of the sparse database on the accuracy and efficiency of the proxy modeling and subsequent parameter estimation inversion. A study aimed at characterizing common damaged states for the marine propeller 4381 is proposed as a possible application for this system.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:17Z (GMT).

Lawrence, Mina Loy, Elizabeth Bowen and Graham Greene, I argue that romantic love arises in these authors‚Äô work not in the conventional pattern that constitutes the "love plot" (from encounter and seduction to crisis and reconciliation), but when the pattern is defied by certain insistent words or figures that preserve the enigma of love as a shock of not knowing. Rather than assimilate love to the rhetoric of self-discovery that the closure of a love plot usually implies, then, the texts I study ask what it means when the experience of love, as an encounter with the limits of self-understanding, shatters the coherence of the text as a quest for personal and historical meaning. Writing against the critical tendency to dismiss love as an outmoded topic in the twentieth century, this dissertation exposes how love, as a seemingly personal experience, surprisingly provokes a variety of epistemological crises in the social realm, from the birth of individuality in Lawrence to feminism in Loy, from the wartime question of responsibility in Bowen to the theological question of redemption in Greene. Despite the unrelenting demystification of love in the polemics of this period, modernist authors are intensely, passionately and often exhaustingly preoccupied with reinventing the language of love. While Lawrence and Loy (both admirers of F. T. Marinetti at some point) deploy the vocabulary of futurism to unleash the potential of deep connectivity while maintaining a sense of selfhood in a love relation, Bowen and Greene (both volunteers during the aerial bombardment of London in WWII) explore how the unprecedented violence of the war generates at once a global sense of paranoia and persistence that turns love, surprisingly, not so much into a self- destruction as a witness to destruction. Far from depreciating love as a serious topic of discussion, these authors instead ask how the resonant language of twentieth-century modernity might renew our understanding of this ageless subject: not only what it is as an ontology but also what it can do as a performance. In engaging the "performative" quality of my literary texts, my dissertation argues that love may reveal its ethical possibility only insofar as it resists the formal (or perceptual) constraint of the text; it is in attending closely to the way in which the formal quality of literature is marred by this resistance, I argue, that we may begin to trace the force (and form a different story) of a radical self-transformation, or of multiplicity, that love occasions in its rhetorical capacity.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:20Z (GMT).

Image and video data capturing these changes is plentiful, but analyzing such data presents many challenges. This thesis presents a set of techniques for modeling, analyzing, and visualizing two key aspects of visual change over time: illumination and motion. The first part discusses the challenging problem of illumination modeling in unstructured photo collections, proposing an approach for shadow detection and sun direction estimation that works on untagged photo collections downloaded from the internet. The second part of the thesis begins by presenting a state-of-the-art method for using motion cues to segment moving foreground objects from static backgrounds. Then, we pose the new problem of how to visualize motions at multiple timescales---from seconds to minutes to hours---in fixed-viewpoint timelapse videos. Two approaches to solving this problem are presented, one based on optimization-driven motion normalization and the other building on the motion segmentation algorithm to segment different timescale videos into foreground layers. The thesis concludes with a discussion of future work, including how the study of illumination and motion might come together to enable further progress in both computer vision and visualization applications.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:18Z (GMT).

However, performance is bottlenecked by the slow electrochemical reaction kinetics of oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution. Accelerating the reaction of oxygen currently requires precious metal electrocatalysts, stifling the prospect of widespread fuel cell and electrolyzer proliferation. Consequently, there has been a concerted effort in discovering alternative bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts, most notably from inexpensive and naturally abundant materials. In particular, complex metal oxides represent a major class of promising new catalyst materials, demonstrating strong catalytic activity and tunability. The sheer breadth of metal oxide systems, underscored by their nearly limitless structural and compositional degrees of freedom, motivates high-throughput synthesis and experimental approaches to expedite and maximize the efficacy of materials discovery. In this study, we performed a range of high-throughput oxygen catalysis measurements on composition-spread libraries of co-sputtered metal oxide thin films. Catalytically active oxides were discovered using a combination of electrochemical screening (cyclic voltammetry, rotating disk electrode, electrochemical impedance, etc.) and versatile high-throughput characterization techniques for structural and compositional mapping. The information from the screening results narrowed the library of potential oxygen catalysts, while identifying novel oxide compounds and structures.  The effective translation from thin film to high-surface-area nanoparticle catalysts not only validates the methods utilized in this study, but demonstrates high-throughput electrochemistry as a crucial and complementary approach to catalysis research.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:19Z (GMT).

I investigated the consequences of decisions about habitat use and species interactions across the full annual cycle on the survival, condition, and performance of Hudsonian Godwits (Limosa haemastica) in Beluga River, Alaska and Chilo√© Island, Chile.  On the breeding grounds, I examined how the benefits of a protective nesting association between godwits and the loud and aggressive Mew Gulls (Larus canus) varied across time and space. Hudsonian Godwits actively chose to nest within gull colonies, but the advantages were context-dependent. Although godwits experienced higher nest survival within colonies ‚Äì presumably because gulls dissuaded nest predators from using the area ‚Äì godwit chicks were more likely to be depredated within colonies. Godwits nesting within colonies were larger (females only) and less attentive (males attended the nest less and gave fewer alarm calls). Nest survival was best explained by individual condition improving with female size within colonies and male size outside of colonies.  Turning to the non-breeding grounds in southern Chile, I assessed the degree to which patch quality, as indicated by density and condition of godwits, was affected by environmental attributes and disturbance from predators and/or human activities. Patch quality was primarily influenced by availability of foraging habitat, foraging success rates, and the responses of godwits to disturbance (i.e., vigilance and agitation). Lastly, I examined cross-seasonal interactions on individual survival and performance. Godwits had high survival throughout the annual cycle, with the lowest survival estimates during the breeding season and southbound migration. I also found evidence of carry-over, or reversible state, effects on future reproductive performance, with individuals in better condition or using higher quality patches on non-breeding grounds achieving higher reproductive success the following spring. Understanding the interactions among stages of the annual cycle, the relative influence of non-breeding and breeding season factors, and the consequences of individual decisions on survival, condition, and performance will help inform conservation for this rapidly declining species.		2/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:21Z (GMT).

Planners strive to improve cities, to make them more equitable, beautiful, sustainable, and resilient. This aspirational quality reveals a particular orientation towards time‚Äîa culture of ‚Äòprogressive futurity‚Äô at the core of the profession, animated by visions of desirable urban futures and strategic claims about how these might be reached. Although planners in the United States rarely talk openly about ‚Äòprogress,‚Äô an intrinsic progressivism remains in American planning. Without it, planning‚Äôs identity and legitimacy would disappear. This dissertation examines how this progressive futurity confronts a slow crisis of urban decline. It follows the City of Detroit‚Äôs urban planners as they grapple with the consequences of population loss, economic collapse, and infrastructural decay. I suggest that the magnitude and duration of Detroit‚Äôs decline‚Äîstretched across the planners‚Äô careers‚Äîhas steadily eroded their capacity for, and their faith in, effective planning interventions. As a result, their working relationship to the future bears little resemblance to the progressive futurity of the wider profession. Instead, Detroit‚Äôs planners routinely engage with the future in deeply personal, human ways, through a ‚Äòphenomenological futurity‚Äô of uncertainty, fate, despair, and hope.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:24Z (GMT).

Block copolymers form ordered assemblies at length scales between that of molecular and colloidal crystals. Self-assembly occurs by confined phase separation, where two or more polymers, covalently bound to each other, fill their miscibility gap with ordered morphologies containing periodicities on the length scale of the polymer chain, roughly 10-100 nm. While the type of morphology and periodicity can be exquisitely controlled, only the simplest of self-assembled morphologies have been successfully prepared as ""mesophase"" single crystals with coherent periodic domains spanning macroscopic distances. 	This dissertation focuses on the complex ordered network structure known as the double gyroid (space group #230, Ia3d), which is prepared by the coassembly of a triblock terpolymer, poly(isoprene)-b-poly(styrene)-b-poly(dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate) (PS-b-PS-b-PDMAEMA, or simply ISA), blended with an oligomeric ceramic precursor, poly(methyl-vinyl-silazane) (PMVS). For the first time, this structure is assembled into single crystal domains that can be identified by eye and easily isolated for further study. These gyroid mesophase crystals span up to 14 mm2, more than three orders of magnitude larger than previously reported. These gyroid nanocomposites are characterized primarily with small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and electron microscopy. Importantly, the ISA/PMVS blends can be converted to ordered porous single crystal ceramic monoliths retaining the double gyroid morphology past 1100 ÀöC, which can subsequently be used as templates for the infiltration of materials with specific functionality (e.g. superconductors). These mesophase single crystals are needed to realize angle-dependent and emergent properties predicted by theory/simulation such as negative refractive index. 	This dissertation begins with an introduction (Chapter 1) discussing classical nucleation theory and block copolymer thermodynamics. Chapter 2 documents the first preparation of the double gyroid morphology from ISA/PMVS blends and their transformation to a double gyroid mesoporous ceramic. Chapter 3 describes the preparation and characterization of double gyroid mesophase single crystals. Chapter 4 examines the behavior of the ISA/PMVS morphology diagram beyond the compositions previously studied. The conclusion (Chapter 5) suggests future experiments to expand upon findings reported in Chapters 2-4."		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:22Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The work is contextualized via archival and historiographic resources from oceanographic institutions, professional societies and historians of ocean science. The dissertation fundamentally addresses the concomitant relationship between innovation (e.g. imagining, planning, constructing, operating) and degeneration (e.g. down-scaling, breakdown, failure, repair). In doing so it argues: (1) Technological solutionism is a widespread ideology that inflects oceanography and can be seen in the turn towards big data. (2) The dominance of technoutopian or tech solutionist imaginaries and narratives drives the character of the infrastructure and can obscure critical less shiny realities of ongoing maintenance and repair. (3) Funding bodies and program managers alike place emphasis on technological sustainability while sidelining issues of labor and human sustainability (overworking, turnover, harassment and grievance, career-building) that can undercut even the best laid infrastructure plans. (4) In these more tender moments of breakdown, hard lessons emerge that often reveal what technology alone cannot fix: problems of labor, inequality, marginality and violence. (5) By making visible narratives of care (for each other and for the environment) in understanding the OOI, I highlight critical power dynamics of building transformative infrastructure, including the gendered and marginalized labor in service of an infrastructure's development and futurism that does not get credited as time-on-task (e.g. mentorship and informal support networks, appealing to and amending grievance reporting, fallout from sexual violence, and accommodating peripheral stakeholders and agents like park services, fisheries, indigenous communities, industry manufacturers, etc.). My focus on care emerged from observing participants and is informed by feminist scholars such as bell hooks. I demonstrate that we must examine care in order to expand our understanding of the human and nonhuman actors that create knowledge about the ocean and, in turn, about the world.

With relatively little public accountability, these organizations exercise influence on policy development and implementation, but despite a long history of documented influence on public policy, private foundations are not usually considered political actors in their own right. They are noticeably underrepresented in existing studies of organizational political participation, despite recent research on foundations' activity that convincingly documents that foundations are important policy influencers through their strategic funding of certain types of work and organizations. However, very little attention is paid to foundations' public policy aims that can only be achieved through legislative, rather than administrative, action. I argue that, contrary to what we might expect, private foundations do support visible political advocacy and they do so in concert with other state- and national-level political efforts.  To examine this claim, I analyze a unique data set of all grants over $10,000 given by private foundations for criminal justice work for patterns in which foundations fund political advocacy, where they fund it, and which recipients are most likely to receive foundation funding. I find that foundations are more likely to focus on policy now than in the past, and while most foundations are likely to fund some type of advocacy, foundations that work consistently in an area and work across states are most likely to fund political advocacy. In addition, foundation funding is stratified geographically, accumulating into significant differences in whether states have private funds available to support their criminal justice reform work. Finally, because foundations do prefer certain types of organizations, recipient organizations exercise their own agency by adapting to their environments to be better suited for receiving funding. These findings have implications for inequalities of political voice and representation, as well as when and how private wealth is able to influence public outcomes.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:24Z (GMT).

In the field of organic electronics, organic materials are an attractive alternative to inorganic materials due to their lower cost and inherent flexibility. In addition, organic molecules can be readily integrated into biological systems to perform functions on the molecular and cellular level. In this work, we explore three condensed organic systems using computational modeling methods. First, we investigate the formation of a heterojunction formed by two organic semiconductors: C60 growth on pentacene. This system is driven by an interest in flexible electronics, effective charge transport characteristics, and organic solar cells. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics and kinetic monte carlo simulations, we elucidate the growth mechanics and surface morphology as a function of temperature. Second, we investigate the solution-phase structure of sulfonated oligothioetheramides (oligoTEAs), which will allow us to probe the interface between chemical sequence and macro-molecular structure. By understanding the atomic and molecular configuration space, we can predict macromolecular binding and target recognition in biological contexts. Here, we were able to validate and illuminate the mechanics behind oligomer collapse using aqueous phase molecular dynamics. Finally, we characterize the mechanical and chemical properties of an organic woven material, COF-505, which couples the flexibility of organic molecules with the strength of covalent or- ganic frameworks. Using molecular dynamics and a suite of optimization methods, we parameterize a force field describing this material. Subsequently, we characterize gas diffusion through COF-505 as a function of thermal and mechanical stress. While this new material has yet to be deployed in an applied setting, we expect this new hybrid material to have applications related to gas adsorption and carbon capture.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:25Z (GMT).

Governments' deficits are inversely related to the credibility and strength of implicit guarantees granted to the banking sector, affecting the tail risk properties of banks' loan portfolios. I predict and find a positive relation between governments' deficits and banks' loan loss provisions. The fiscal effect is statistically and economically stronger than the relationship between business cycles and banks' loan loss provisions, and is moderated by the country's debt-to-GDP ratio. My results are robust to different sample partitions and after controlling for potentially confounding effects. To address endogeneity concerns between fiscal policy, business cycles, and banks' financial reporting decisions, I identify fiscal shocks by estimating innovations to governments' military expenditures. Results from an instrumental variables approach support the association between fiscal shocks and banks' loan loss provisions.   Taken together, my results shed light on how fiscal policy decisions affect banks' financial reporting choices.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:26Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In particular, I trace the shifts in the ways language, the human body, and nature came to be intertwined in a complex network of relations that redefined the way knowledge came to be produced. By emphasizing the crucial relation between kokugaku and empirico-practical fields, such as the medical-pharmacological rise of honz≈çgaku (ch. bencaoxue) in the 1700s, I seek to show how anatomy and nature came to be central in the ways kokugaku scholars imagined the role of people in the world. Mindful of the immense changes occurring in Eighteenth Century Edo intellectual landscape, I argue that it is impossible to account for the rise of kokugaku without taking into consideration the shifts in social perception of the role of nature. Instead of anchoring kokugaku within the teleological paradigm of incipient nationalism ‚Äì a relation foregrounded since the Meiji period, and later championed by philosophers in the decades of Japanese empire ‚Äì my dissertation shows how the excess of nature, as a repository of conceptual and practical knowledge about the world, often guided these scholars‚Äô philological archaeology of the "pristine" relation between language and the body.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:27Z (GMT).

874f6cae-2230-484c-bbe8-a0a4ad7f5609	123456789/41792			Olson, Katelin Elizabeth		Tomlan, Michael Andrew		Sachs, Aaron||Campanella, Thomas J.	2018-10-22T18:47:33Z			8/30/18		Three miles east of downtown Buffalo, NY, the Broadway-Fillmore neighborhood was the historic epicenter of the city‚Äôs Polish community starting in the 1880s.  Using case studies, the following work investigates the natural and architectural history of one corner of the neighborhood, recognized in the early 20th century as the parish of Corpus Christi Roman Catholic Church.  Once one of the city‚Äôs densest areas, the neighborhood experienced a precipitous physical and demographic decline in the mid-20th century.  Vacant lots and dilapidated residences now characterize the space, interspersed between three iconic structures:  the Central Terminal, Corpus Christi R.C., and the Broadway Market.  The crux of the project revolves around exploring how the Broadway-Fillmore corridor transformed from the heart of a vibrant, largely working class community into its current, struggling, diminished physical state.  This central inquiry spawned a number of related questions.  What specifically occurred in the neighborhood‚Äîwhat decisions were made, what strategies were employed, what issues ignored or debated‚Äîthat exacerbated its decline?  How did the character of the land itself, now compressed under cracked asphalt and the intermittent foundation, affect human usage?  What can the histories of three anchor complexes teach us about the impacts of decisions on the neighborhood‚Äôs built and natural spaces?  How did external mid-century urban planning decisions intensify neighborhood challenges?  Finally, what role should nostalgia play in neighborhood advocacy, how does the literature on historic preservation address it, and how can preservation narratives be used to encourage culturally inclusive histories?  A micro-history of a working class neighborhood in an American post-industrial city, this work demonstrates that history is not a linear process.  Instead, it is formed in layers.  Events‚Äîgeological, ecological, environmental, sociological‚Äîcompile over time and are manifest in the natural and built landscapes.  Careful analysis can contribute to nuanced historic narratives that promote inclusivity within urban and historic preservation planning.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:33Z (GMT).

Besides the development of novel transient materials, advanced electrospinning techniques have also been utilized to increase a materials surface area, which can result in a faster decomposition rate. Thus, it would be of interest to explore the unique characterization of electrospun transient fiber mats made of low-ceiling temperature polymers and their potential usage as support substrate for microelectronic devices.  This work reports the first transient electrospun nanofiber mat triggered by UV-irradiation using poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC)/poly(phthalaldehyde) (cPPA) polymer blends. The ability to trigger room temperature transience in nanofibers mats without the need for additional heat or solvent expands its utility in non-biological fields, especially for transient electronic devices. The addition of a photoacid-generator (PAG) to the system working in combination with UV light provides an acid source to enhance degradation since both polymer backbones are acid-sensitive. Electrospinning enables the production of PPC/cPPA composite nanofiber mats capable significant degradation upon exposure to UV radiation while maintaining relatively high mechanical properties. An acid amplifier (AA), an auto-catalytically decomposing compound triggered by acid, was used to generate more acid and accelerate nanofiber degradation. The electrospun fiber mats can be post-annealed to achieve an improved mat mechanical strength of ~ 170 MPa.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:28Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

During this transition, the oocyte completes meiosis and remodels its transcriptome and proteome through post-transcriptional and post-translational regulations to prepare for embryogenesis. Phosphoregulation is a particularly important type of post-translational modification at the time of egg activation. In addition to the prevalence of protein phosphorylation state changes during this transition, conserved phosphoregulators like calcineurin and CaMKII are essential for egg activation in different species. Since the phosphorylation state of a protein is tightly associated with its activities, the proteins that are subject to phosphoregulation during egg activation are likely involved in the transition from oocyte to embryo. In this dissertation, I present my studies on the function and regulation of proteins that go through phosphorylation state changes during egg activation in Drosophila. With germline-specific RNAi, I tested the function of 189 such proteins in female fertility, and identified 53 proteins whose germline depletion led to defective oogenesis, as well as 51 proteins whose germline depletion led to significant impairment or abolishment of the eggs' ability to hatch. By carefully examining the knockdown phenotypes, I identified a set of regulators that are essential for processes in both early oogenesis and early embryogenesis, and revealed 15 proteins with new roles in egg activation and embryogenesis. To explore the mechanisms that mediate the phosphorylation state changes of proteins during egg activation, I investigated the activity of phosphoregulator calcineurin in this transition using proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis. I quantified the phosphorylation state changes and protein abundance changes that occur during egg activation, and examined how these changes are affected when calcineurin function is perturbed in female germ cells. I showed that calcineurin is involved in the regulation of hundreds of phosphosites upon egg activation, and is also required for the abundance changes of numerous proteins during this transition. My results indicate that eggs with perturbed calcineurin activity fail to exit metaphase I, likely due to unsuccessful activation of APC/C. I also showed that calcineurin activity is required for Pan Gu kinase activation, and affects the phosphoregulation of several other regulators of protein translation upon egg activation. In summary, my studies showed the functional importance of proteins that are phosphoregulated upon egg activation, and shed lights on the mechanism of phosphoregulation during this transition.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:35Z (GMT).

While ever-increasing numbers of human genetic diseases can be linked to defects in the splicing pathway, our molecular understanding of how these mutations disrupt this complex process remains incomplete. To identify mutations which impact the splicing pathway I have developed a series of targeted-sequencing based quantitative genetic screens in S. pombe, a yeast species which is genetically tractable yet retains features of complex splicing patterns that have been lost in the S. cerevisiae lineage. Through these screens I have isolated conditional alleles of spliceosome components and investigated the mechanism by which some of these mutations disrupt splicing. Furthermore, I have identified genes in other nuclear processes, such as transcription and chromatin remodeling, which contribute to splicing outcomes. These findings suggest splicing is largely co-transcriptional and suggest specific genes by which transcription is functionally linked to splicing. Finally, I describe a novel approach for enriching RNA-sequencing libraries for splicing-informative reads. This technique allows for precise quantitation and discovery of rare splice products, including splice intermediates, which are poorly captured in other RNA-sequencing methods.

Like a diploid hybrid, allopolyploids will have two versions, or homeoalleles, for every gene. Partial functional redundancy between homeologous genes should result in a deviation from additivity. These epistatic interactions between homeoalleles are analogous to dominance effects, but are fixed across subgenomes through self pollination. An allopolyploid can therefore be viewed as an immortalized hybrid, with the opportunity to select and fix favorable homeoallelic interactions within inbred varieties. With the availability of affordable genotyping and a reference genome to locate markers, breeders of allopolyploids now have the opportunity to manipulate subgenomes independently and fix beneficial interactions across subgenomes. I present a statistical framework for partitioning genetic variance to individual subgenomes of an allopolyploid, predicting breeding values for each subgenome, and evaluating the magnitude of homeologous epistasis. I also present a subfunctionalization epistasis model to estimate the degree of functional redundancy between homeoallelic loci and to determine their importance within a population. I search for genome-wide patterns indicative of homeoallelic subfunctionalization in a winter wheat breeding population by anchoring homeologous marker sets to the IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 sequence. Some traits displayed a pattern indicative of homeoallelic subfunctionalization, while other traits showed a less clear pattern. Using genomic prediction accuracy to evaluate importance of marker interactions, I show that homeologous interactions explain a significant portion of the non-additive genetic signal. Allopolyploids have traditionally been treated as diploids in breeding programs because they undergo disomic inheritance. With modern DNA marker technology and ever increasing computational power, I provide a new framework for breeders of allopolyploid crops to characterize the genetic architecture of existing populations, determine breeding goals, and develop new strategies for selection of additive effects and homeologous epistasis in these ancient immortal hybrids.

From site visits and in-depth interviews, I consider the remains of Fuhe Grand Theatre, which Tsai Ming-liang bid farewell to in Goodbye, Dragon Inn (2003), as an accidental archive of the materiality of cinema. I then locate its afterlives in Chu Yin Hua's photographic project Goodbye, Goodbye Dragon Inn (2007) and the digital restoration of King Hu's restored Dragon Inn (1967), to argue for the luminous intertwining of cinematic worlds as a mode of survival. In Chapter Two, through the elliptical editing of In the Mood for Love and the various forms of substitution (one lover for another) on the level of plot and also of location, I develop the conventional practice of creating geographical illusions as part of the palimpsestic invisibilities of cinema. I argue that this invisible substitution, common in the practice of filmmaking, forms an interstitial non-encounter that has ethical implications. In Chapter Three, I connect this analysis of the surfacing of invisibilized worlds to the affective screenscapes of post-2010 independent cinema in Singapore and Malaysia that contest authoritarian narratives of progress. "Luminous Flesh, Haunted Futures" concludes with imaginations of alternative futurities in two video series: Tsai Ming-liang's seven-part "Walker Series" (2012‚Äì2015) and Charles Lim's multi-year "SEA STATE Series" (2008‚Äìpresent). This dissertation shows that the phantomaticity of cinema can illuminate the phantasms of sovereignty. Through foregrounding the densities and textures of my archives, I argue that the visible world of cinema operates as an "as if," in which each film constitutes a world-making project of memory and forgetting, and is embedded in unequal networks of psychical, physical and spectral relations.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:43Z (GMT).

To enable removal of synthetic chelators in response to increasing consumer demand for clean label products, metal-chelating active food packaging technologies have been developed with demonstrated antioxidant efficacy in simulated food systems. However, fabrication of metal-chelating materials in the proof of concept research leveraged batch processes (e.g. degassing, and long reaction in solution) to immobilize metal-chelating ligands, and had limited industrial translatability for large-scale fabrication. In this dissertation work, various synthesis techniques were investigated to the scalability of the material preparation processes. A scalable laminated photografting technique successfully replaced batch degassing process originally required to prepare functional surfaces. Finally, a photocurable metal chelating copolymer coating was developed to enable potential simple coat/cure preparation of materials. Iminodiacetic acid (IDA) was investigated as a primary metal chelating ligand and was immobilized onto food packaging materials using the above techniques. The surface chemistry, chemical chelating performance and antioxidant performance against oxidative spoilage (lipid oxidation and ascorbic acid degradation as model systems) of the resulting IDA functionalized materials were demonstrated.		2/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:44Z (GMT).

Every year, significant proportion of the commercial maize production is lost to insect herbivores and phytopathogens despite extensive control measures. This global issue can be alleviated by harnessing the innate biochemical defense mechanisms of maize, which may have been sacrificed over the course of crop domestication for higher yield. In this thesis, I use Fusarium graminearum, a widespread fungal pathogen of maize, as a model pathosystem, to study the genetic and physiological control of maize specialized metabolism and biochemical defense. By integrating untargeted metabolomics and transcriptomics data into quantitative genetics framework, I am able to discover novel regulatory genes and mechanisms of specific metabolites, as well as to establish a metabolome-scale resource of metabolite-genetic loci associations at high resolution.  Through comparative metabolomics analyses, I identify two F. graminearum-resistancerelated acetylated diferuloylsucrose compounds, smiglaside C and smilaside A, which have not been confirmed in maize previously. In an in vitro fungal growth inhibition assay, only the diacetylated smilaside A demonstrates significant bioactivity, whereas the tri-acetylated smiglaside C does not. Genetic mapping of these two compounds, alongside with mutant analyses and physiological experiments, show that ethylene signaling can regulate the metabolism of these two compounds. While ethylene production is required for the accumulation of both compounds in planta, their relative abundance is fine-tuned by ethylene sensitivity. Interestingly, the relative abundance, rather than the absolute amount of these two compounds appears to have a more significant influence on maize resistance against F. graminearum infection.  In the same genetic mapping population, genetic mapping and metabolite-transcript correlation analyses suggest that a putative vesicular transport protein is a negative regulator of accumulation of benzaoxazinoids, the most abundant class of specialized metabolites in maize seedlings. This hypothesis is partially supported by genetic mutant analyses and pharmacological disruption of the vesicular transport system in planta. However, further experimental evidence is required to establish a role for the vesicular transport system in benzoxazinoid metabolism. Finally, the chemical genetics approach is extended to a much more diverse maize genome-wide association mapping diversity panel. Multivariate statistical analyses of the large untargeted metabolomics dataset reveal that different classes of specialized metabolites are selectively differentiated between developmental stages and genetic subpopulations. Using liquid chromatography retention time as a proxy of metabolite structure relatedness, it is shown that structurally similar metabolites tend to be co-regulated by shared genetic loci. To demonstrate the utility of the thousands of metabolite-genetic loci association, I experimentally validate that different alleles of a maize citrate synthase gene is responsible for the different structural isomers of hydroxycinnamic acid-hydroxycitric acid conjugates accumulated in the tropical versus temperate maize inbred lines.   In summary, work presented in this thesis demonstrates the power of integrating multiomics dataset to dissect specialized metabolism in maize. It provides examples of metabolic and regulatory gene discovery using a forward genetics approach, and set up a platform for future validation of candidate genetic loci associated with potential metabolites of interest.

However, the reaction mechanism of Cu2-xS versus Li has not been elucidated. Also, as the technology advances, Cu2-xS nanoparticle can be synthesized with great control over size, morphology. Whether this will benefit the battery performance of Cu2-xS remain a question. In this thesis, we studied the structural change of Cu2¬¨-xS (three different phase particles, anilite Cu1.75S, roxbyite Cu1.81S and djurleite Cu1.94S) during discharge versus the lithium foil. Several advanced characterization tools (X-ray diffractometer, high-resolution transmission electron microscope) and electrochemical testing (galvanostatic charge-discharge) are used to observe the structural and electrochemical behavior. As a result, we proposed a common reaction mechanism for Cu2-xS versus Li-ion.          Moreover, given the ability to synthesis Cu2-xS nanoparticle with excellent size, morphology and dispersity control [5], we studied the size-dependent electrochemical properties of Cu2-xS. We found as the size of the particle decrease, the electrochemical curve resembles more like a supercapacitor while as the particle becomes bigger, it shows discharge plateau which is typical to battery material. With Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, we studied the electronic structure of the material which helps us to explain this interesting behavior.

The thesis proposes a heterogeneous framework for citywide subway capitalization studies by adding station fixed effects to the standard practice of hedonic method. Results suggest that for second-hand homes, subway proximity is a significant determinant of housing prices. The 2008 car driving restriction has increased the value of proximity for second-hand homes, but only for those within the 8km-radius of subway stations. The 2014 bi-monthly lottery restriction induces an unexpected but robust negative effect on proximity values, which probably implies that gentrification has started to take place in neighborhoods that are near subway stations.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:47Z (GMT).

The increasing population caused huge pressure on food supply which relies on staple crop production such as corn and soybean. However, microalgae as a novel generation of feedstock have drawn great attention due to their various advantages and applications. They can not only be supplemented in animal diets as protein ingredients but also be cultured to produce health beneficial phytochemicals such as astaxanthin and DHA for human consumption. Therefore, we conducted three studies in broiler chicks to: (1) measure the nutrient retention and digestibility of 10% Nannochloropsis oceanica as a protein ingredient; (2) investigate the bioavailability of microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis for producing astaxanthin enriched meat products and its effect against heat stress, and (3) explore the effect of microalgae Aurantiochytrium on growth performance, health status and meat production and quality. Our finding demonstrated that (1) nutrient retention and digestibility of 10% Nannochloropsis oceanica were largely unaffected except retention and digestibility of amino acid were decreased; (2) dietary Haematococcus pluvialis supplementation could enrich astaxanthin in meat products and change endogenous antioxidant defense, and (3) feeding up to 2% of Aurantiochytrium had no effect on growth performance, health status, and meat quality and production. In summary, dietary microalgae supplementation could be beneficial to animal nutrition and human health by providing potential protein feed ingredient, improving meat production and quality, and producing phytochemical-rich foods.

Intricate control on the sizes of semiconductor nanoparticles results in profound control over the bandgap making absorptions and emissions increasingly efficient. However, synthesis of scalable amounts of size focused nanoparticles remain the biggest challenge in the industry. A polydisperse distribution of sizes corresponds to a variation in its properties which nullifies the primary motivation for using nanoparticles. Moreover, for nanoparticles to become a standing competitor in the semiconductor industry, there is a need to establish synthesis procedures compatible with scalable large-scale nanoparticle manufacturing without undermining their crucial dimensional influence. These procedures are prey to a wide variety of parameters starting from the preliminary salts, their chemical interactions to physical stimulus making optimization of each material on a large scale all the more difficult. We substantiate this need with a nanoparticle reusability concept wherein any batch of polydisperse particles can be transformed to a size tuned group with the help of an etchant (Oleylamine or Chlorine) and re-grown with heat-up technique. This post synthesis treatment enables the use of large-scale synthesized particles and tune their sizes corresponding to the desired application. In this thesis, we were successful in tuning the size to 8.5nm with a dispersity of 7%. The etchant is used to decrease the size variation in the polydisperse batch and produce monomers. Monomer saturations, in turn, combat competitive growth or Ostwald ripening and instead help the larger particles to grow uniformly when heated up. Our investigations are heavily concentrated in the Cu2-xS system which is viewed as a practical substituent to other toxic counterparts like Cadmium or lead-based semiconductor nanoparticles. Understanding this system forms a conceptual foundation for manipulating related ternary and quaternary compounds like Copper-Indium-Sulphide(CIS) or Copper-Tin-Sulphide(CTS) which have a host of applications of their own. We also elucidate a method of utilizing high concentration scalable production to create phase pure batches of Mohite CTS. These particles exhibit band gaps ranging from 1.04eV to 1.38eV which is suitable to most optoelectronic applications like solar cells and photodetectors. Future work would be to extend the particle reusability to other systems, investigate the influence on associated ternary and quaternary compounds thus probing a step closer in making this approach acceptable commercially. Furthermore, creating devices from these size tuned particles and reviewing any improvements would exhibit great progress in the study of copper-chalcogenide nanoparticles and their potential in the industry.

To manage the diseases under economically competitive conditions, breeding switchgrass for resistance and silicon amendment were two potential approaches. Screening methods in a greenhouse were established for BSR in seeds and BLS in 4-week-old seedlings. Half-sib progenies were used to estimate narrow-sense heritability of resistance to the two diseases. Moderate heritability estimates of resistance to BSR suggested successful gain from selection, whereas non-significant heritability of resistance to BLS suggested no progress from selection. Such heritabilities accurately predicted the result from two cycles of recurrent phenotypic selection in ‚ÄòCave-in-Rock‚Äô and ‚ÄòShelter‚Äô. The progress of resistance to BSR was more than 50% cycle-1 in both cultivars whereas the progress of resistance to BLS was not significant. Such difference between resistances to BSR and BLS resulted in no correlation between the disease resistances. To dissect the resistance to BLS, genome-wide association was conducted in the Northern Association Panel. The BLS evaluation was conducted in 479 mature switchgrass plants via field evaluation, detached leaf assay, and leaf disk assay. Multi-trait Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from different phenotype combinations in four subgroups revealed potential resistance genes associated with 18 markers on chromosomes 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 5a, 5b, 6a, 7a, 8a, 9a, and 9b explaining phenotypic variances of 6.32 to 26.72%. Within linkage disequilibrium of 20 kb, there are some potential resistance genes including genes encoding Myb, cytochrome P450, isocitrate lyase, E3 ubiquitin-protein, etc. These markers can be used in genomics-assisted breeding in the future. Besides breeding, silicon amendment has also explored the potential based on the effectiveness against BLS in rice. However, for switchgrass in a greenhouse, silicon amendment (either incorporated into the potting mix or foliar drenches) showed no significant effect BSR and BLS, suggesting more studies are needed on field application and long-term effects of silicon.

It is home to a supermassive black hole (Sgr A*), 3 massive stellar clusters (the Arches, Central and Quintuplet clusters), and several isolated massive stars which are spread throughout the inner ~100 pc. In this dissertation, I present mid-infrared imaging data of three regions in the Galactic center including the Arches and Quintuplet clusters, and the H HII regions. Observations of these regions were taken with the Faint Object infraRed CAmera for the SOFIA Telescope (FORCAST) at 19.7, 25.2, 31.5, and 37.1  um. These data trace warm dust (~100 K) in the surrounding environment of stars and provide constrains on physical properties of the sources such as luminosity, mass, and temperature.  The Arches cluster is surrounded by a grouping of molecular clouds which are heated and ionized by the cluster. Both the clouds (known as the Arched Filaments) and the cluster are named for the arc-like appearance of the clouds which are one of the most striking large scale features in the Galactic center. We examine the distribution of dust temperatures across the clouds in the region and find that they are relatively uniform (70-100 K) even though the filamentary clouds have a large physical size (~25 pc). Equilibrium heating analysis of the dust indicates that the characteristic grain size is smaller (~0.01 um) than typical values for the interstellar medium (~0.1 um). We also find evidence for depleted abundances of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Both the grain size and the PAH depletion indicate processing of material in the clouds and may be explained by shocks or other processes occurring in the region. Adjacent to the Arched Filaments there is a collection of HII regions associated with isolated massive stars known as the H HII regions. Studying these sources provides important information on the prevalence and distribution of massive stars in the region and understanding their origin may provide insights on other field stars which are observed throughout the Galactic center. Observations with SOFIA/FORCAST provide high-angular resolution maps (~4") which allows us to study the detailed morphology of four of the HII regions. Analysis of dust temperatures show that three of the spatially extended objects require multiple heating sources, and we identify potential stellar counterparts. We also compare the size and morphology of the HII regions and argue from this that the properties of H2 are consistent with in situ star formation. Last, we identify 8 new sources that may be part of the H complex and provide initial characterizations of their infrared emission.  The Quintuplet Proper Members (QPMs) are a collection of five bright infrared sources for which the Quintuplet cluster is named. These sources are thought to be binary systems with a carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WC) star and O/B companion. Dust production by these types of systems are poorly understood and constraining their mass-loss history can provide insight on this process. We produce models of the dust emission associated with the four detected sources using the radiative transfer code DUSTY and show that Q2 and Q3 are best fit by radial density profiles which are consistent with constant mass-loss rates. In contrast, Q1 and Q9 show shallower radial density profiles indicating more vigorous mass loss in the stars' recent past. Q9 is particularly interesting because it has a massive dust reservoir which is significantly larger than the other QPMs. N-band imaging obtained with the Gemini Telescope reveal an extended dusty nebulae associated with the source which suggests the material may have been produced by a recent episode of enhanced mass loss from the star. Such events are atypical of dusty WC stars, and we suggest that the dust may have been produced in an earlier phase of the star.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:51Z (GMT).

Emergency preparedness and the ability to respond to and recover from catastrophic events is a critically important element for all communities.  There is not a standard response mechanism used nationally despite having the existence of organizations such as FEMA.  States vary in the response mechanisms in place, but some communities have set up programs to address catastrophic events.  This study focuses on New York counties utilizing emergency coordinators and supporting organizations within governmental agencies and across their communities to establish protocols and ensure action plans are in place.  The Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) is one group tasked with information transmission in counties as mandated by the state, but it is not implemented to the same degree in all areas.   This study seeks to understand the use of LEPCs in upstate counties (outside New York City and Long Island) to clarify communication mechanisms used and compare with state level data on communication effectiveness in both rural and urban settings.  In general, counties rely on the Emergency Management Coordinator to develop sound communication networks to plan for disasters.  There is also support for the development of mechanisms to better inform community residents both in planning and implementing recovery efforts after a disaster.

To date, the only treatment that exists for those afflicted by this disease is total replacement with prosthetic valves. This presents a huge challenge for biomedical engineers as no functional tissue engineered replacement has been created. The closest biological analogue currently used for total valve replacement are porcine valves. Like their human counterparts, these porcine bioprosthetics have limited lifetimes in vivo and more than often require future replacement. A significant reason for this limited in vivo performance is due to immune-mediated degradation. Unfortunately, there is limited knowledge towards how immune cells, specifically macrophages, regulate valve interstitial cell behavior during disease or failure in animal-derived bioprosthetics. The valve field has yet to provide functional data that can garners insight into how cells of the innate immune system can regulate valve cell behavior. This information is critical for not only getting a better understanding of potential disease mechanisms and failure modes of animal-derived bioprosthetic valves, but for guiding principal strategies for future tissue engineering approaches. The work presented in this thesis, provides initial insight into how different phenotypes human macrophages can drive disease programming of porcine valve interstitial cells within mechanically constrained 3D-environments. Studying the effects of macrophage-derived factors provides clear unidirectional communication between these cell types which reduces complications of co-culture. Using 3D mechanically constrained hydrogels as a model system provides more insight into these features with more physiological relevance as valve cells are fibrotic and are exposed to high mechanical loads in vivo. This work shows how phenotypic extremes of human macrophages along an inflammatory continuum can differentially drive different disease programming in porcine valve cells, which is contrary to current approaches in the field which argue that one extreme is better than the other.  Overall this work provides significant initial glimpses into macrophage regulation of valve cells and failure of porcine-derived bioprosthetic valves. This work clearly demonstrates that the extreme M1 / M2 delineation of macrophage phenotype that is a current target of many bioengineering approaches can worsen performance and behavior of valve interstitial cells.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:52Z (GMT).

An initial partnership with the Great Lakes Research Alliance for the Study of Aboriginal Arts and Cultures (GRASAC) opened the door for discussions on the inadvertent assumptions held by non-Native researchers, the role of collaboration with Indigenous communities, and the utility of multivocality and digital media in creating a useful and meaningful resource. Collaboration with On√∂ndowa‚Äôga:‚Äô community partners through a workshop at the Seneca Art and Culture Center in Victor, New York, identified how the descendant community wished to organize and present the wide variety of locally-produced materials, trade goods ultimately derived from Europeans (including those locally-reworked for different functions), commodities that were produced and exchanged by other Indigenous groups, and their spatial information. In conjunction with the Cornell University Library through the Digital Collections for Arts and Science Grants Program, the project is currently digitizing items to be presented through a multivocal website with a nested structure. This thesis focuses on the process of creating this resource, dealing especially with the ways myself and my advisor, Kurt Jordan, have chosen to rectify assumptions and missteps made during the beginning stages of the project.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:53Z (GMT).

With a Q=10 matching network, -27 dBm sensitivity and 22% efficiency can be achieved for about 0.5 V DC output to a 500 kŒ© load at 570 MHz. On the other hand, the sensing variation can originate from the targeted biological sensing signal, which complicates both the sensor system design and the associated signal analysis. We will illustrate a spike-sorting method to reliably classify the enteric neural signals which have unique waveform features but large variation in magnitude, timing and duration. The proposed fastDTW spike classification algorithm provides improvements in accuracy and computational cost in comparison with Cross-correlation based template matching and PCA + k-means clustering without time warping. When appled to mouse ENS neurons in high noise and high variability environment, fastDTW successfully recognized spikes with variability is as large as 1.2 ms in width and a few milli-volt in magnitude. The captured waveform features are used for variation correlation analyses to better understand the operating principles of enteric nervous system. Although other variation sources can also affect the sensor system design, our approaches of device compensation based on operational feedback and signal tolerance based on time warping are able to give illustrations for sensor designers to successfully countermeasure uncontrollable variation sources.

Archer, Lynden A.||Bonassar, Lawrence	2018-10-22T18:47:55Z			8/30/18		Stereolithography is a rapid, high resolution, and scalable additive manufacturing technique that uses patterned light to build a solid object, layer-by- layer, from a liquid resin of photopolymerizable material. However, the material processing requirements, namely low viscosity and rapid photopolymerization, previously restricted printable materials to highly crosslinked and glassy polymers that exhibit low ultimate strains and prevent technical applications in biomedicine and soft robotics. This dissertation begins by reviewing the existing literature‚Äôs attempt to additively manufacture soft machines, particularly soft robots. With the problem defined, I then attempt to address the gaps in materials compatibility with stereolithography printing by designing two chemical platforms. First, by incorporating dynamic ionic linkages between anionic nanoparticles and cationic acrylates, we demonstrate tough, elastomeric polyacrylamide-based hydrogels. Such ionic composite hydrogels exhibit fast gelation, remarkable ionic conductivity (ÔÅ≥1MHz =1.8x10-3 S m-1 ), and large ultimate elongations (ÔÅßult > 400%) and can be printed into osmotic actuators and soft conductive traces. Second, employing thiol-ene click chemistry of mercaptosiloxanes and vinylsiloxanes enables precise control of the polymer network density and thereby the mechanical properties over orders of magnitude (stiffness, 6 kPa < E < 330 kPa; ultimate elongation, 50% < ÔÅßult < 400%). A simple, low cost modification to common commercial desktop printers enables printing of this silicone chemistry into highly resilient soft machines. Fluidic elastomer actuators, when fabricated through this method, can be pressurized with the base liquid resin to impart autonomic self-healing upon puncture in ambient sunlight.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:55Z (GMT).

Their promise has intensified the demand to scale-up NP synthesis from a scientific discovery to an engineered technology. Two limiting factors to scale-up include inherent sensitivities within conventional methods, that are amplified at larger scales, and several gaps in fundamental understanding regarding the synthetic mechanism. Hence, more rational and reliable synthesis methods (i.e., process intensification) are critical to enable NP-based technologies.  This work presents efforts to produce a robust and scalable NP synthesis platform, using a heat-up method in a regime of previously unexplored high concentrations near the solubility limit of the precursors (1000 mM). In this highly concentrated and viscous regime, NP synthesis parameters are demonstrated to be less sensitive to variation and thus more reliable for scale-up. Overall, this method enables a 10-fold increase in NP volumetric production compared to conventional methods, while still producing high-quality NPs (<7% RSD).  High concentration synthesis also fosters a precise reaction pathway for the isolation of high-quality (>99.9%) magic-sized clusters (MSCs). MSCs are ultra-small (<2 nm) single-sized NPs that are stable against typical growth / dissolution processes and intermediate to larger NP formation. This work demonstrates that the enhanced stability, and thus purity, of MSCs at high concentrations stems from the simultaneous production of an extensive (>100 nm grain size) hexagonal mesophase assembly that shields the MSCs from further growth. Subsequent chemical treatment of these MSCs reveals that clusters differ substantially from larger NPs. In one case, the chemical treatment triggers a reversible transformation between two distinct, stable MSCs, reminiscent of molecular isomerization reactions. Ultimately, the robust and precise nature of highly concentrated NP synthesis enables both large-scale nanomanufacturing and enhanced synthetic understanding.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:56Z (GMT).

This fusion process mainly consists of two steps. First one is docking which is to bring the vesicle into the proximity of neuron membrane, against the repulsive forces from electrostatics and hydration. The forces necessary to overcome this repulsion are provided by a family of proteins known as SNARE. Second step is fusion pore formation, which leads to the release of the neurotransmitter, for its collection by the next neuron. We have studied the process of synaptic vesicle fusion using Continuum and CG molecular models. Continuum models of the vesicle and neuron membrane are used to understand the deformation and forces in the membrane system in response to the SNARE and repulsive forces. In another study, a CG-model of SNARE is combined with continuum model of the membranes to analyze the deformation and forces during docking. Our calculations show that about 4-7 SNARE complexes are needed to "dock" the vesicle. Using a continuum model, we estimated the docking time of a synaptic vesicle under the effect of hydrodynamics. We found out that it is the nature of the force generated by the docking machinery which governs it. We have also developed a CG model incorporating lipid bilayer membrane and SNARE complexes to better understand the dynamics  of  the  fusion  process.

Compared to the widely used practice of product placement, RPP is relatively unused and unexamined. This study addresses opportunities for RPP and explores consumer motivations to engage with or to avoid a special form of RPP‚Äîexperiential products. Data from consumer interviews are used to develop a conceptual model of consumer interaction with experiential RPP. Findings highlight the role of consumer involvement with the entertainment content from which a RPP is derived, the influence of perceived sacredness of the fictional domain on one‚Äôs motivation to consume an experiential RPP, as well as the potential sources of value that consumers attain or hope to attain by experiencing a "live" version of a "fantasy" context.

In \S$1$ we go over Thurston's classification of \emph{automorphisms} of $S$: continuous functions $f:S\to S$ with continuous inverses. The classification provides an $f_\#$ homotopic to a given automorphism $f$, which is either: periodic ($f_\#^n$ is the identity for some $n\ge1$); or $f_\#$ fixes a finite union of disjoint circles $\gamma_i:S^1\hookrightarrow S$; or is what Thurston calls pseudo-Anosov (pA). In the pA case, there is a finite number of points on $S$ whose complement carries two transverse foliations by $1$-submanifolds each with a holonomy invariant measure on transverse arcs. Such a structure on $S$ can be described in terms of a quadratic differential on a Riemann surface structure on it which we go over in \S$1.2$. Further, there is a number $\lambda_f\ge1$ (called the \emph{dilatation} or \emph{stretch factor}) such that the two measured foliations are stretched and shrunk respectively by $\lambda_f$ under $f_\#$.\\ When the foliations of a pA map $f$ can be oriented consistently in neighborhoods on $S$, the dilatation $\lambda_f$ is an eigenvalue of the induced action $f_*$ on the homology group $H_1(S;\mathbb{Z})$. The numbers $\lambda_f$ thus satisfy monic polynomials with integer coefficients. Fried \cite{Fried} showed that $\lambda_f$ is a unit in $\mathbb{Z}[\lambda_f]$ and that the Galois conjugates of $\lambda_f$ (excepts perhaps one of $\pm\lambda_f^{-1}$) lie in the open annulus $\{z\in\mathbb{C}:1/\lambda_f<|z|<\lambda_f\}$. Numbers satisfying these properties are called \emph{biPerron}. If the Galois conjugates of an algebraic integer $\lambda\ge1$ are only in the disk $\{|z|<\lambda\}$, it is called a \emph{Perron} number. We describe Fried's proof and some properties of dilatations in \S$1.3$. In \cite[Problem 2]{Fried}, Fried asked whether some power of a biPerron unit is always a surface automorphism stretch factor. This thesis is an attempt to solve this problem. \\ In \S$2$ we go over a well-known rectangular decomposition of a Riemann surface with a quadratic differential. When the associated foliations are orientable, the quadratic differential is the square of an Abelian differential and we study this latter structure on a Riemann surface in some detail.\\ A square matrix $A$ of non-negative entries is called \emph{mixing} if some power $A^n$ has only positive entries. If only the sum $A+A^2+...$ is positive, $A$ is \emph{ergodic}. By the Perron-Frobenius theorem, an ergodic matrix has a real eigenvalue $\lambda>0$ (called the \emph{Perron root}) bigger than all its other eigenvalues in absolute value, and whose eigenspace is $1$-dimensional. If the matrix has integer entries, the Perron root is a Perron number. Lind \cite{Lind84} showed the converse that all Perron numbers are eigenvalues of ergodic integer matrices. In Chapter 3 (see \cite{BRW16}), under additional hypotheses on an erdogic matrix $A$ with entries in $\{0, 1\}$ we construct a closed orientable surface $S$ of genus $g\le\dim{A}/2$ with a self-homeomorphism $f$ such that the dilatation $\lambda_f$ is the Perron root of $A$ (which is therefore biPerron).\\ On the other hand, Hamenst\"adt \cite{Hamen13} showed that out of dilatations smaller than $R>0$ on a surface of fixed genus $g$, the proportion of those that have only real Galois conjugates approaches $1$ as $R\to\infty$. This suggests Fried's conjecture may be false and motivated our study of the asymptotic behavior of biPerron units which we present in chapter 4. Let $B_g(R)$ be the set of bi-Perron units no larger than $R$ whose minimal polynomial has degree at most $2g$, and say $D_g(R)$ is the set of dilatations no larger than $R$ of pseudo-Anosov maps with orientable invariant foliations on $S_g$.\\ Eskin-Mirzakhani-Rafi (2016) and Hamenst\"adt (2016) independently showed that the number of periodic orbits of length less than $\log(R)$ for the Teichm\"uller flow on the moduli space of area one Abelian differentials on $S_g$ grows like $R^{4g-3}/{\log(R)}$ as $R\to\infty$. This is an upper bound for the number of dilatations, $|D_g(R)|$. We showed (with H. Baik and C. Wu) that $|B_g(R)|$ grows like $R^{g(g+1)/2}$ as $R \to\infty$. Since dilatations $D_g(R)$ form a subset of biPerron units $B_g(R)$, we get that for $g\ge6$ the proportion of dilatations $D_g(R)$ inside biPerron units $B_g(R)$ approaches $0$ as $R\to\infty$. Our result does not disprove Fried's conjecture.\\ For the lower genera (2, 3, 4 and 5) we get an interesting result as well. If there are exactly $n$ closed geodesics in Moduli space of the same length $\log(\lambda)$, we say $n$ is the \emph{multiplicity} of each of these geodesics. For geodesics bounded in length, the proportion of those closed geodesics that have multiplicity greater than some positive integer $k$ approaches $1$ as the bound in length approaches $\infty$. That is, asymptotically almost all geodesics in Moduli spaces for these genera have arbitrarily high multiplicities.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:47:59Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

It is therefore important that the national freight transportation system is designed and operated efficiently. Hence, this dissertation develops a mathematical model to estimate international and domestic freight flows across the ocean, rail and truck modes, which can be used to study the impacts of changes in our infrastructure, as well as the imposition of new user fees and changes in operating policies. The model integrates a user equilibrium-based logit argument for path selection with a system-optimal argument for rail network operations. This leads to the development of a unique solution procedure that is demonstrated in a large-scale analysis focused on all intercity freight and U.S export/import containerized freight. The model results are compared with the reported flow volumes. The model is applied to two case studies: (1) a disruption of the seaports of Los Angeles and Long Beach (LA and LB) similar to the impacts that would be felt in an earthquake; and (2) implementation of new user fees at the California ports.

Nitrification is mediated by both bacteria and archaea to ultimately oxidize NH3 to nitrite (NO2‚Äì), though there are also complete NH3-oxidizing (comammox) bacteria capable of oxidizing NH3 completely to nitrate (NO3‚Äì). In addition to these products, nitrification is also a major source of the by-products and environmental pollutants nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Many steps of biological nitrification, including those leading to the production of these harmful products, are not currently clear; however, the work presented in this dissertation describes recent efforts and discoveries towards a complete understanding of the nitrification pathway. This process begins in both bacteria and archaea with the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase (AMO), which oxidizes NH3 to hydroxylamine (NH2OH). There exist two metal-binding sites in AMO of interest as these are highly conserved in AMOs and related enzymes. The true active site of this enzyme remains in debate, but here we show that both sites must remain intact for effective catalysis. In bacteria, the formed NH2OH is further oxidized to NO by the enzyme NH2OH oxidoreductase (HAO), though prior convention stated that HAO was able to oxidize NH2OH fully to NO2‚Äì. There exists another enzyme in NH3‚Äìoxidizing bacteria (AOB) known as cytochrome (cyt) P460 that can oxidize NH2OH to NO and N2O. Here we present structural and mechanistic studies that describe how the unusual P460 cofactor and surrounding amino acids allow for this catalysis. The recent discovery that the true product of HAO is NO and not NO2‚Äì presents a challenge to find the enzyme in AOB which can complete this oxidation to the final product NO2‚Äì. Here we present a potential candidate, nitrosocyanin (NC), and describe preliminary experiments on its interaction with NO.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:00Z (GMT).

Fast-cycling intestinal stem cells (ISCs) marked with leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) are located at the bottom of the crypts and proliferate once every day to provide new cells. Despite the continuous renewal and turnover of the small intestinal epithelium, the intestinal crypt maintains a ‚Äòsoccer ball-like‚Äô, alternating pattern of stem and Paneth cells at the base of the crypt. To study the robustness of the alternating pattern, we used intravital two-photon microscopy in mice with fluorescently-labeled Lgr5+ ISCs and precisely perturbed the mosaic pattern with femtosecond laser ablation. The work presented in this dissertation provides a new type of behavior of Lgr5+ ISCs in addition to the proliferation and self-renewal, which is critical to maintain integrity of small intestinal epithelium in homeostasis.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:01Z (GMT).

Among several existing techniques to convert biomass into biofuels or chemicals, biomass thermochemical conversion is particularly promising for non-food sources of biomass, such as wood, agricultural residue or energy crops. This conversion process results from a strong coupling among several chemical and physical processes over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, making it difficult to comprehend. The design and scale-up of the reactors for biomass thermochemical conversion, typically fluidized bed reactors, are mostly based on empirical correlations, relying heavily on expensive and lengthy pilot-scale reactor studies. The recent advances made in high performance computing (HPC) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), show a great potential in using CFD tools for the design and optimization of these conversion reactors. However, at present, the usage of these tools is severely limited. This work improves the current state-of-the-art modeling and simulation tools for biomass thermochemical conversion by focusing on some of their most limiting aspects. To this end, we focus on the modeling of chemical kinetics and particle-scale processes of biomass thermochemical conversion, and explore the effect of multiphase flow (gas-solid flow) on the particle-scale processes in the conversion reactor. In the first part of the work, a compact chemical kinetic model is developed for the reactions of the biomass conversion and is shown to be computationally affordable to use with CFD tools. The second contribution includes the modeling of particle-scale processes of biomass conversion under large uncertainties in the model parameters, allowing for a rigorous validation study of the model against detailed experimental measurements. Apart from developing models for different processes of biomass conversion, the influence of multiphase dynamics on the particle-scale processes is also evaluated by performing several three-dimensional detailed CFD simulations of a laboratory-scale conversion reactor. As these detailed CFD simulations would be prohibitively expensive to perform for large-scale reactors, a reduced-order model, in the form of a differential equation, is developed to predict the performance of the reactor. The modeling and simulation tools developed in this work allow probing biomass thermochemical conversion process in great detail.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:02Z (GMT).

Hallmarks of joint disease often involve degradation of articular cartilage tissue, which leads to patient disability and pain. Articular cartilage cannot heal very effectively on its own, and there is a limited understanding on which therapeutics would be most effective in disease treatment. Because of the inherent complexities of cartilage, it is often difficult to predict how therapeutics will be transported through the tissue, especially for larger molecules. 		For proper development of effective therapeutic strategies, a better understanding of transport of larger therapeutics is needed. First, a review of molecular transport in cartilage is presented to better motivate this work (Chapter 1). There are many molecular and environmental factors that affect transport for larger solutes, such as hydrodynamic size and/or molecular weight (Chapter 2), charge (Chapter 3), and the presence of fluid flow within the tissue (convective transport) (Chapter 2 ‚Äì 4). Additionally, the heterogeneities in composition within the tissue is important and can be used to predict cartilage transport (Chapter 5). Finally, this new macromolecular data informed the development of a predictive framework under which transport of solutes over a wide range of sizes can be accurately predicted (Chapter 6)."

Such flow is still occurring today as a result of the growth and collapse over the last ice age of massive ice sheets and is evident in changes of the Earth's surface and gravity, a process called glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). This thesis presents a new technique for computing this viscoelastic deformation and statistical methods for more efficiently inferring properties of the Earth's mantle and the deglaciation from geophysical observations. The first chapter introduces an updated time-domain method for computing the viscoelastic Love numbers --- normalized spherical harmonic responses of an Earth with radially symmetric properties. The method employs a novel normalization and coordinate transformation that, when used in combination with the relaxation method for two-point boundary value problems, yields a very effective method of computation that is applicable to a wide range of possible rheological models. The second chapter describes a geometric perspective of GIA modeling using a heuristic example of the sea level response of a single ice cap melting, a prototype of a full inversion of global rheology and deglaciation. By considering the locus of all possible model predictions, a surface called the model manifold, we demonstrate universal features of nonlinear models, such as edges where parameters unphysically go to infinity, and how these can interfere when inferring parameters from data. Applying geometric corrections to the Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares algorithm facilitate finding the best-fit on the model manifold without getting stuck on an edge, even when started from far away. The final chapter employs a different aspect of this perspective, optimal experiment design, to evaluate the geophysical constraints on the configuration and volume of the Barents Sea Ice Sheet over the last glacial cycle and propose maximally constraining observations. Available observations of GIA in the Barents Sea cannot distinguish between a single, large dome and a more moderate amount of ice in the north. Experimental design identifies an area in the central Barents Sea within which a single observation of uplift would be very constraining.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:04Z (GMT).

The main goal is to reinterpret the role of the African press in the making of South African capitalism by revealing overlooked intimacies between print companies and consumers. Between 1932 and 1962, European settlers controlled the most popular newspapers and magazines enjoyed by African readers, and scholars have since viewed these white-owned, African-oriented periodicals as either supporting Apartheid by suppressing radicalism or challenging Apartheid by spurring creativity. But I suggest that beyond being a large-scale ideological battleground, scholars must also recognize that the African press fueled much more localized interactions in social and economic life‚Äì‚Äìfrom rural sales networks to urban sightseeing destinations‚Äì‚Äìand that these interactions shaped South Africa‚Äôs commercial fabric.  	At the same time, by pursuing several analytical experiments, the secondary goal is to challenge common contrasts between older mediums like print and newer mediums like social networks. In the last few decades, the rise of digital media has led many sociologists, media theorists, and other scholars to posit sharp historical breaks between the present and the past. But I show that one of the most heavily stressed breaks‚Äì‚Äìa perceived shift from media systems dominated by professional producers to those supported by amateur contributors‚Äì‚Äìhas often been misleadingly framed. Each of my chapters documents a different way that pre-internet audiences directly aided the development of media businesses, suggesting several new paths for comparative research on other countries and mediums."		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:05Z (GMT).

For those films to be effective, they must remain unoxidized. During IC manufacturing, thermal cycling would often oxidize the thin film even with trace amount of oxygen in the environment. Once the metal/metal nitride oxidized, they would no longer remain its functionality. Therefor diffusion barrier with low oxygen diffusion flux and permeability is needed in a thermally active environment. This work investigated the oxygen permeability of Y2O¬¨3 and Al2O3 thin films utilizing optical study of a Zr indicator layer. Diffusion barriers were deposited on a Zirconium layer and were thermally oxidized in an oxygen environment. Optical thickness measurement of the formed ZrO2 layer were measured and the oxygen diffusion flux and permeability were experimentally determined. Cubic bixbyite Y2O3 was determined to be a poor diffusion barrier against oxygen. Its oxygen permeability ranged from 1.40E-12 to 2.32E-9 mol/cm*sec with different oxidation temperature, time and barrier thickness. The oxidation and oxygen diffusion behavior at 500¬∞C were significantly different than the 300¬∞C and 400¬∞C oxidations. It was experimentally determined that the oxygen diffusion flux in Y2O3 had little dependency with Y2O3 barrier thickness below 400¬∞C and the flux decreases with increasing Y2O3 thickness at 500¬∞C. Possible diffusion mechanism involves Fick‚Äôs diffusion and pipe diffusion but requires future experiment to be testified. Experiments had also shown that Y2O3 diffusion barrier reacted differently to repeating heating and cooling at different temperatures and generally could not be applied as an oxygen diffusion barrier. Corundum bixbyite Alumina films were tested using the same procedure as the Y2O3 films. Experiments showed that complete coverage Alumina film with thickness greater than 2nm had negligible oxygen diffusion flux and permeability at 300¬∞C, 400¬∞C and 500¬∞C. Therefore, Alumina thin film could be applied as oxygen diffusion barrier at below 500¬∞C environment.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:06Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

It is an ethnography of the South‚Äôs largest agricultural industry, of the production and consumption of cheap food through a cheapening of labor, but fundamentally, of people, places, and daily life. It is also a reflection or mirror on what we, as a society, have become, one that quite literally disregards, dismembers, and disables life for the comfort and wealth of a very few. Finally, it is a critique of the world as it stands from the perspective of workers moving in and out of "the poultry," and an exploration of how change might emerge from this way of seeing, "from way, way below." To understand poultry work and workers, we must understand how workers are made and re-made, but also how they shape production and consumption, as well as the broader communities in which they live, work, eat, move, celebrate, and resist.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:06Z (GMT).

The RAD9A-HUS1-RAD1 (9-1-1) complex is a DDR component that functions as a heterotrimeric DNA binding clamp that promotes checkpoint signaling and DNA repair. Loss of 9-1-1 function has severe consequences, including embryonic lethality, genomic instability, subfertility and hypersensitivity to replication stress.  To fully understand the role of the 9-1-1 complex in DNA repair, we first utilized a targeted mutation approach to identify functionally important residues of HUS1 that drive clamp formation, DNA interactions, and downstream effector functions. These studies revealed that both checkpoint signaling and DNA repair by the 9-1-1 complex separably promote genome maintenance. Next, a proteome-wide screen identified novel HUS1interactors and uncovered a new role for the 9-1-1 complex in regulating protein neddylation. As Hus1 loss results in radial chromosome formation and hypersensitivity to inter-strand crosslinking (ICL) agents, phenotypes also seen in the genome instability syndrome Fanconi Anemia (FA), we investigated the relationship between the 9-1-1 complex and the FA DNA repair pathway. Our studies suggested that the 9-1-1 complex was essential for recruitment of several FA proteins during ICL repair. Furthermore, the 9-1-1 complex also protected stalled replication forks against MRE11-dependent fork degradation. Overall, these data suggest a role for the 9-1-1 complex in coordinating multiple signaling and repair proteins required for accurate ICL repair.   DDR proteins are known to protect against cancer-initiating mutations in normal cells; however they also support tumor growth at later stages, allowing cancers to tolerate elevated stress levels associated with malignant transformation. We explored the role of HUS1 in cancer, and discovered that Hus1 deficiency decreased cell transformation in cultured cells and decreased tumorigenesis in mouse models of lung and skin cancer. Expression analysis in multiple cancer cell lines revealed that HUS1 levels in cancer can increase through a mechanism involving alternative polyadenylation.  In sum, this dissertation decodes distinct functions for the 9-1-1 complex in DNA repair and tumorigenesis, and identifies novel interactions between HUS1 and effectors important for genomic integrity and cell survival.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:07Z (GMT).

These interactions exist across scales in the environment, with implications from field to molecular levels. Work spanning these scales is presented, highlighting DOM dynamics in agricultural soils under different management as well as laboratory based studies of model biomolecule-mineral interactions. Field level studies show the amount and characteristics of DOM differ greatly between surface and subsoils. Observed depth trends in DOM are influenced by tillage, with tilled soils exhibiting two discreet distributions in DOM characteristics. A punctuated change from sorptive partitioning of surface DOM inputs to source driven DOM dynamics in subsoils is observed in tilled systems with no-till soils showing a gradual transition between the two. Molecular-level studies of protein (bovine serum albumin (BSA)) and nucleic acid (deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)) interaction with the common soil minerals montmorillonite and goethite demonstrate the interplay between biomolecular characteristics and the kinetic, equilibrium and conformational aspects of adsorption. Furthermore, studies were conducted with both BSA and DNA in solution together. Under these conditions, assembly of BSA and DNA in solution is shown to impact the mechanism and quantity of biomolecule adsorption on goethite. These results enhance our understanding of organic matter interaction with soils at two distinct scales, both through probing DOM transformation in agricultural soils and mechanistic studies of biomolecule adsorption on minerals.

The first half of the thesis relates to images, image formation, and optimization, first physically and then computationally. Chapter 2 contains an introductory level description of the basic physics of image formation in the electron microscope. The aim is rigor sans mathematical formalism, beginning with a visual approach to the complex integrals of optics and wave propagation. We then turn to an investigation of lenses which stresses the dual real/reciprocal space nature of lens action and information transfer in a microscope, touching briefly on Abbe theory and resolution limits. Finally, the physical basis of the contrast transfer function and optimum focus conditions in the presence of lens aberrations are discussed for weak phase objects, followed by a short description of advanced imaging modes. From physical image formation we turn to computational processing to obtain the best quality images, and Chapter 3 takes up the question of how best to achieve high signal-to-noise ratio images by registration and alignment of image stacks, when low SNRs and high translational symmetry cause a strong propensity toward unit cell misalignments. After demonstrating the subtly specious images that can result from incorrectly aligned data, which can be particularly problematic in low SNR cryoSTEM data, a solution is described whereby all possible pairs of images are aligned, and incorrect alignments are then identified and corrected by enforcing physical consistency in the complete set of alignments. The latter half of the thesis relates to applications in two systems in which structural disorder is an essential element. Chapter 4 focuses on epitaxially bonded quantum dot superlattices. In these materials, the theoretical promise of unprecedented bandstructure control is limited in practice by structural disorder, which localizes the relevant charge carrier states such that a band picture is unsuitable and transport is dominated by thermally activated hopping. Chapter 4 both quantifies in detail and explicates the basic nature of the structural disorder in quantum dot superlattices. Translational as well as orientational disorder are discussed in both the atomic lattice and superlattice, a connection is established between the disorder across many orders of magnitude of length, and the implications for electronic structure and growth are addressed. Chapter 5 examines charge density wave materials, in which the lattice positions and charge distribution of a crystal are modulated with some periodicity larger than the unit cell. A method for locally mapping fields of periodic lattice displacements at each atomic site is developed, and applied to a charge ordered manganese oxide to reveal picometer scale, transverse displacements fields of the lattice. Nanoscale spatial heterogeneity in two orthogonal modulations is revealed, and competition between the two fields is suggested by their local spatial anti-correlation and the detailed structure of their defects. Conclusions are in Chapter 6.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:09Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

To do so, it asks a set of interrelated research questions: how does cultural difference affect assimilation? How do Muslims immigrant population culturally adapt to the secular context of Western European nation-states? How does upward mobility impact the acculturation patterns and experiences of religious stigma among the rising immigrant elite? Three separate studies provide answers to these questions. The first study is a large, theoretically-driven review of the last decade of immigrant incorporation scholarship in America and Western Europe. Through a comparative lens, it identifies large empirical trends toward assimilation, but also the unique role played by religious and cultural difference in the European context - a role not foreseen in assimilation theory. The second study uses large-scale survey data from France to investigate assimilation between Muslim immigrants and natives in terms of religiosity. Using a unique research design, it uncovers the role of parental socialization and perceived discrimination in shaping a religiosity surplus among Muslims compared to the reference population. The third article, a qualitative analyses of the subjective experience of upwardly mobile immigrants in France, uses thirty-eight in-depth interviews to provide a first empirical look at the rising immigrant elite. It shows that non-Muslim immigrants typically feel they have achieved status and respect in the French community, while Muslim immigrants generally still feel like cultural outsiders despite high levels of socioeconomic attainment.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:10Z (GMT).

In the past half-century men and women have be- come more equal in many economic and social dimensions, but vast differences in outcomes remain. The causes of these differences, whether they be cultural norms, preferences or economic constraints, are important and the subject of these essays. The first chapter is on the the sorting of men and women into occupations. Results indicate that women sacrifice wages in order to avoid male dominated occupations, but that temporary shocks to the number of men or women in an occupation do not persist in the long run. The second chapter studies how married households decide who works in the labor market and who works in the home. Men are found to want to work less if their wives work, whereas women are found to want to work more if their husbands work. The third chapter looks at whether families in the United States prefer to have sons instead of daughters and finds that although households with daughters are more likely to be female headed, they are no longer more likely to go on to have more children.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:11Z (GMT).

However, due to limited understanding on interfacial transportation of magnesium, stagnant progress is made in terms of high surface impedance, compatible cathode material and etc. Herein, we systematically examine the relationship between current density and magnesium deposition in diffusion-limited region by introducing the concept of over-limiting current. To evaluate, we develop a set of method to regulate the morphology of the magnesium and propose a possible scheme of magnesium deposition mechanism which is proved by Sand‚Äôs formula and the result of in-situ observation. Most interestingly, a dendritic morphology of magnesium deposition is detected for first time during observation.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:12Z (GMT).

Both plants and AM fungi releasesignaling molecules, reviewed in Chapter 1, that initiate signaling pathways leading to thecellular changes necessary for symbiosis. Two major types of AM fungal signaling moleculesare short-chain chitooligosaccharides and lipochitooligosaccharides, which are both glucanoligomers. Additionally, AM fungal walls contain chitin and other glucan molecules that mustcome into close contact with plant cell membranes. Plant LysM receptors bind to chitin andother glucans at the cell membrane and trigger a ligand-specific signaling response, either fordefense or symbiosis. Thus, I hypothesize that certain plant LysM proteins are important forAM symbiosis. Throughout this work, I utilized Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated roottransformation of Medicago truncatula for RNA silencing, described in Chapter 2, and otherexpression and localization studies. In Chapter 3 I targeted LysM receptor-like kinases thatmay participate in relaying fungal signals via their intracellular kinases. In Chapter 4 Icharacterized small Medicago LysM proteins that surround arbuscules and may be importantfor both arbuscule development and degeneration. Finally, in Chapter 5 I characterized asmall effector-like LysM protein from the AM fungus, Rhizophagus irregularis, which isunder positive selection and can bind to chitin and chitosan. Despite their specific expression,intriguing localization, and subtle effects on colonization as a result of mutation or overexpression,none of the Medicago LysM proteins proved essential for AM symbiosis, likelydue to redundancy within their gene families. Deletion of multiple genes at once still does notdisrupt the interaction. Such robustness is not surprising in light of 300 million years of asymbiotic relationship growing ever more stable throughout evolution.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:12Z (GMT).

Random or long-interval data collection will miss temporary spikes in contaminant concentrations. This leads to underestimates of harmful chemical concentrations, which in turn affects risk assessment, hazard assessment, and further conclusions made from quantitative data. A year-round, once daily sampling scheme paired with temporal adjustment factors is proposed to accurately assess the impact on amphibians. The daily sampling technique has potential additional uses for assessing the impact of other environmental contaminants on amphibians, which are particularly susceptible to aquatic chemical contaminants due to their permeable skin and aquatic developmental phases of life. In this paper, the herbicide atrazine and its presence in fresh waterways is explored in relation to current standardized aquatic sampling techniques, as well as the need to make changes in sampling that could be applied in the field, directly impacting assessments relating to amphibians.

With LSA the polymer is subjected to much higher temperatures but for a far shorter time compared to traditional thermal annealing, resulting in an induced disordering temperature that increases as the heating/cooling cycle decreases. Such a trend arises from the LSA time scale being shorter than the time scale for the ODT at the thermodynamic ODT temperature, but longer than the polymer relaxation time scale. In this work, we use molecular dynamic simulations of a simple coarse- grained model to study the phase behavior of a general lamella-forming A-b-B di- block copolymer thin film under different heating cycle lengths, film thickness, and substrate-polymer affinity. This model describes a realistic soft confinement scenario to study the effects of a free surface (air-polymer interface) and solid substrate selectivity on thin film morphology. Our simulation results successfully capture a similar trend for the ODT temperature as in LSA experiments (for comparable heating cycle lengths) when the vertical lamella phase formed on neutral substrates. In addition, simulations with a substrate selective for a particular block revealed the formation of a metastable island phase having horizontal but incomplete lamella layers. The nanoscale roughness features of this island phase could be of potential use to modulate the wettability of surfaces as the degree of roughness can be controlled to some extent with suitable choices of polymer chemistry and the annealing conditions.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:14Z (GMT).

Why are some groups within civil society able to enter into cooperative relationships with state actors, while others are repressed or ignored? Using the example of environmental activism in Russia and China, I gain leverage on these questions by examining four tactics that activists use to interact with the state ‚Äì leveraging international influence, engaging in mass mobilization, seeking justice through the legal system, and participating in formal and informal relationships with policymakers. Despite China‚Äôs more closed authoritarian system, I find that Chinese environmental groups have greater access to policymakers and are more able to contribute to governance. While in Russia, environmental groups are mostly excluded from governance and often specifically repressed. I argue that this can be explained by considering each state‚Äôs different approach to the dilemma of information and control and how that is shaped by differences in political structure, the regime‚Äôs basis of power, and major historical traumas. Evidence is drawn from over 13 months of fieldwork and more than 140 interviews with relevant actors in Russia and China.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:15Z (GMT).

Since environmental parameters controlling these biogeochemical cycles can be controlled, it is important to understand how changes in these parameters can affect nutrient and greenhouse gas cycling and concentrations. Thus, we chose to examine the effects of two poorly-understood parameters, the presence of aerenchymal roots and flow rate, by measuring concentrations of several nutrients and gases on two heavily controlled mesocosm constructed wetlands planted with Schoenoplectus acutus and maintained at either high flow (20 ml/min) or low flow (10 ml/min). There was no difference in overall nitrate removal efficiency between the two mesocosms. However, our results indicate that increased flow rate was associated with higher oxygen and nitrate concentrations in the porewaters. The presence of aerenchymal roots increased methane and decreased nitrous oxide concentrations as compared with substrate containing no roots. The differences in methane and nitrous oxide patterns may be due to aerenchymal plants competing for N-uptake with microbes and highlights the importance of species diversity and richness in studying the impact of plants on wetland control. The study also demonstrated the key role that subsurface flow rates, and the associated property of hydraulic retention times, can play in the biogeochemical functioning of constructed wetlands.

In cyclic loading, persistent slip bands (PSBs) have been studied since the late 1950s as a mechanism for void and crack formation in fatigued single crystals. Several models exist that offer an explanation for the formation of persistent slip bands. Of these, only a few potentially extend to polycrystalline aggregates, where the manner in which PSBs manifest is unclear. From these models, however, a recurrent ingredient is the presence of localized slip. In this work, we explore the necessary tools to characterize the localized slip and other deformation heterogeneities within a polycrystalline material using crystal plasticity models. First, we examine how to characterize heterogeneous intragrain deformation using kinematic and diffraction metrics. Next, we present a smooth crystal lattice orientation assumption imposed upon each crystal in order to allow for networks of slip to form and cross grain boundaries. Finally, we go over necessary frameworks to characterize the formation of slip networks across the sample.		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:17Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 3

In Chapter 1, I investigate the design of optimal Intellectual Property (IP) policy by exploring a unique policy in the U.S. over-the-counter (OTC) pharmaceutical market. Over-the-counter (OTC) versions of prescription drugs can improve access and affordability. To incentivize firms to convert prescription (Rx) drugs to OTC status, the first firm to gain approval for OTC sales of a prescription drug  (Rx) enjoys three years of market exclusivity granted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Firms usually, but not always, delay OTC entry until the end of their Rx patent protection. This paper studies how the FDA provision of market exclusivity affects firms' time of entry into the OTC market and, ultimately, consumer welfare. To separate the multiple offsetting incentives in this market, I perform a structural analysis of anti-ulcer drugs, where many, but not all, molecules have been converted at varying points in their lifecycle. The model recognizes imperfect substitution between Rx and OTC drugs and allows an endogenous pricing equilibrium and dynamic OTC entry decisions. I find that OTC market exclusivity policy, which is intended to increase the number of OTC drugs, actually hurts consumers by delaying OTC entry until an Rx drug patent expires. For example, without the market exclusivity policy, AstraZeneca would have introduced Nexium OTC in 2011 instead of at patent expiry in 2014. I propose an alternative policy in which market exclusivity is preserved after patent expiration to an OTC drug that is introduced more than three years earlier than patent expiration, and find that the policy eliminates the incentive of strategic delay, and enhances consumer welfare.  Chapter 2 examines the choice of dialysis clinics by dialysis patients and how capacity and various quality measures affect the choice. I leverage rich data with the detailed history of firms' capacity and quality characteristics. I find that clinic capacity is a key variable that drives the choice of ESRD patients among different dialysis clinics. Firms respond to patients' preference by allocating resources toward capacity expansion through dialysis station purchases as well as mergers and acquisitions. I provide the estimates of relative weight that patients place on capacity relative to quality, and by this decomposition, I offer a framework for evaluating the marginal returns of investment in capacity expansion versus quality improvement. In Chapter 3, which is joint work with Sam Kleiner, we study the Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) designation program, a federal entry-cost subsidy and financial reward program to attract and retain primary-care physicians, dentists, and mental health professionals to serve in underserved areas and to aim at alleviating geographical physician supply disparity in the United States. We exploit the quasi-exogenous variation in the HPSA designation status. Designation and withdrawal frequently occur in the same year---the in-and-out of areas provides the source for identification. Our results suggest that HPSA designation is associated with an increase in the number of primary care doctors. We also show the dynamics between the HPSA designation and the number of primary care doctors.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:18Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This is an immanent critique of these articulations of time that I label under the name of messianic temporalities. In particular, I contend that the messianic organization of time in Latin America demands a serious study as an analytical concept useful for addressing the question of the future of struggles for freedom. I advance the notion of messianic temporalities as a means to interrogate and reactivate the logics of a radical transformation of the present. In this dissertation, I provide a critical mapping of the shape and effects of the messianic within Latin American political structure through its aesthetic production that ranges from literary materials to contemporary art and experimental video. Ultimately, I assert the importance of distancing ourselves from this concept in order to address new temporalities of revolt that break with a present order that does not seem to end.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:19Z (GMT).

The body of this dissertation is organized into three main sections. The first is dedicated to the clinical validation of several consumer sleep monitoring devices. The ability to investigate sleep is of scientific and clinical interest. Polysomnography has long been considered the gold standard assessment for sleep physiology; however, its cost and inconvenience have spurred the development of consumer devices capable of evaluating sleep outside the laboratory. Device performance is compared against polysomnography, inter-device comparison is made, and suggestions for device improvement tendered. In the second section, design, prototyping, and pilot testing of a novel genioglossal strengthening device intended as a non-pharmacological intervention for Obstructive Sleep Apnea is detailed. In the third, several novel non-pharmacological interventions for the treatment of insomnia are detailed: the first, a simple and comfortable garment with lateralized thermal properties that promotes either thermal conduction or thermal insulation depending upon body position, is intended to allow sleepers to auto-regulate proximal skin temperature through subtle movements during brief transient arousals, preserving overall sleep architecture and improving sleep quality; the second, a specially constructed insulating palmar / plantar muff that promotes either heat retention or heat dissipation depending upon digit flexion or digit extension, respectively, is intended to allow sleepers to auto-regulate distal skin temperature through subtle movements during sleep; the third, a wearable method of cutaneous warming, is based on the established functional link between distal vasodilation and sleep induction and employs localized heating of the hands and feet to induce vasodilation of the underlying blood vessels, increase blood flow to the extremities, increase distal skin temperature, promote net body heat loss, and facilitate sleep onset; and the fourth, a novel two-degree-of-freedom mechatronic bed, is based on the demonstrated link between motion-induced vestibular stimulation and sleep induction. Encouraging preliminary data was obtained in pilot testing of our prototype devices. Taken collectively, the devices and results presented herein show great potential to treat the two most common sleep disorders.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:25Z (GMT).

However, spin-orbit torques have an important limitation ‚Äì in the vast majority of samples, the current-generated spin direction is required by symmetry to lie in the sample plane and perpendicular to an in-plane applied current, i.e., a Rashba-like symmetry. This means, for example, that spinorbit torques can drive the most current-efficient type of magnetic reversal (antidamping switching) only for magnetic devices with in-plane anisotropy, not the devices with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy that are needed for highdensity applications. In this dissertation, I outline a promising approach for reducing those symmetry requirements: using a single crystalline spin-source material with low structural symmetry to alter the symmetry constraints of the generated spin-orbit torques.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:27Z (GMT).

Yet, although these highly reactive molecules can be damaging, ROS can also elicit beneficial effects in cells as signaling molecules. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where ROS are produced from protein folding, the Hsp70 BiP plays a role in cell protection during ER oxidative stress. BiP is a chaperone that binds and release substrates, and these activities are regulated by its ATPase cycle. We have previously discovered that yeast BiP‚Äôs conserved cysteine gets modified by the ROS peroxide during oxidative stress conditions. Our lab discovered that the protein Sil1 functions in cells as a reductant that can remove the modification on BiP‚Äôs cysteine. The reductant activity of Sil1 is mediated through two N-terminal cysteines. Sil1 has been well- characterized as BiP‚Äôs nucleotide exchange factor (NEF) that facilitates ADP release. Sil1 is active as a NEF even in the absence of its N-terminal region. A molecular picture as to how the N terminus, which contains the redox-active cysteines, influences interaction with BiP remains unclear.  Our biochemical characterization of the full-length Sil1 has revealed that the N-terminal domain plays a role in modulating Sil1 activities. We uncovered that the presence of the N-terminal domain decreases Sil1 NEF activity and impacts the structural conformation adopted by full-length Sil1. We have mapped the region of the N terminus that accounts for the auto-inhibition of Sil1 NEF activity to a stretch of 36 amino acids of highly conserved sequence. Mutations in human SIL1 have been found in patients with Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome (MSS). One such mutation, R92W, is in the conserved N-terminal region. Through the characterization of the yeast version, Sil1-R84W, we have demonstrated that the mutation increases NEF activity, impacts reductant activity, and changes the apparent conformation of Sil1. Our overall findings suggest that the N-terminal domain‚Äôs conserved region is important in regulating Sil1 activities. We predict that this region may undergo post-translational modifications in cells to modulate NEF and reductant functions of Sil1 under specific physiological conditions.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:28Z (GMT).

How do these identities figure into discourse around environmental issues? Research on discursive framing and identity has thus far focused on identity constructs such as race, class, gender, and ethnicity. Through a mixed methods analysis of several data sources including transcripts of Philadelphia City Council meetings from 2007 to 2017, I analyze how policy-makers, local environmental groups, and national/regional environmental groups employ place-based framing to define, explain, and propose solutions to environmental problems. I contrast place-based frames with "global" frames that center arguments for policy change on the national or global implications of environmental problems such as climate change and deforestation. My results reveal that place-based framing is a dominant mode of discourse in Philadelphia environmental policy discussions and that actors may employ frames strategically so as to appeal to place-based identities and further political goals.

Herpesvirus-induced ocular disease, which may lead to blindness, commonly occurs in humans, dogs, and cats, and is caused by human alphaherpesvirus 1 (HHV-1), canid alphaherpesvirus (CHV-1), and felid alphaherpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), respectively. Rapid and effective antiviral therapy is of the utmost importance to control infection in order to preserve the vision of infected people or animals. However, current treatment options are suboptimal, in large part due to the difficulty and cost of de novo drug development and the lack of effective models to bridge work in in vitro cell cultures and in vivo. Repurposing currently approved drugs for viral infections is one strategy to more rapidly identify new therapeutics. Furthermore, studying ocular herpesviruses in cats is of particular importance, as this condition is a frequent disease manifestation in these animals and FHV-1 infection of the cat is increasingly being recognized as a valuable natural-host model of herpesvirus-induced ocular infection 	First, the current models to study ocular herpesvirus infections were reviewed. Next, the efficacy of raltegravir was evaluated using a novel corneal explant model. Raltegravir is a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) integrase inhibitor that was recently shown to poses antiviral activity against human herpesviruses. Then, electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) was evaluated as a novel methodology to study the replication kinetics of herpesviruses. It was also used to characterize a fluorescently labeled FHV-1, created using CRISPR/Cas9 genome. Next, it was found that raltegravir inhibits both viral DNA synthesis initiation and late gene expression, a mechanism consistent with inhibition of viral ICP8. Finally, RNA sequencing was used to explore the indirect effects of raltegravir on the host. It was found that raltegravir treatment promoted the expression of anti-angiogenic factors and altered the metabolism of the host cells, both of which may be beneficial therapeutically. 	These results, combined with a recent in vivo study in experimentally infected cats, demonstrates that raltegravir is a viable treatment option for FHV-1 and warrants further investigations into its clinical potential against other herpesviruses."		8/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:29Z (GMT).

This is a timely effort given disparities in obesity and chronic disease risk between individuals of lower- and higher-socioeconomic status and ongoing conversations regarding the 2018 Farm Bill and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) reform. Chapter 1 reviews the persistence of food insecurity in the U.S. and explains the relationship of this issue with our food system before introducing FMIPs and CO-CSAs as possible solutions needing robust evaluation. Chapter 2 introduces this work‚Äôs specific aims and theoretical framework. The aims were three-fold: to conduct a mixed methods process evaluation of F3HK from the perspective of multiple stakeholders (Chapter 3); to calculate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using F3HK to shift users‚Äô FV-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, self-efficacy, food security status, and home food environment (Chapter 4); and to calculate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using DUFB to improve food security status and FV intake among SNAP users (Chapter 5). Results have implications for the implementation of community-based food system-focused nutrition interventions and for the design of federal food assistance and agricultural policy.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:30Z (GMT).

The first line of research focuses on self-judgments of knowledge. People are often required to evaluate their own knowledge in the service of various decisions; how is this evaluation made, and when does it go awry? One way to study overestimation of knowledge is by asking people to assess their knowledge of terms, places, people, etc. that were invented for the sake of research and do not exist. This approach helps reveal when and why people mistakenly believe themselves to have knowledge that they could not possibly have, a phenomenon called overclaiming. Across two papers, I demonstrate that people are more likely to overclaim knowledge about nonexistent terms when they perceive themselves to be overall knowledgeable about the topic from which the terms are drawn. However, self-perceptions of overall knowledge can be dissociated from true knowledge. I also find that the more people are genuinely knowledgeable about a topic, they less likely they are to overclaim ‚Äì i.e., to mistakenly believe they have knowledge of nonexistent terms related to their topic of expertise.		8/22/20	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:31Z (GMT).

These III-V materials will be doped, typically with Si as a dopant. However, dopant activation remains an issue, compounded by the fact that there is still insufficient knowledge of the ease and preferred mechanistic pathways by which dopants, like Si, become activated within the III-V matrix. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Nudge Elastic Band (NEB) calculations, we have determined many of these critically important properties, namely, the energy barriers associated with the diffusion of both intrinsic point defects and silicon impurities in prototypical III-V materials, here Zinc Blende GaAs, InAs and the CuAuI-ordered ternary In0.5Ga0.5As. Refuting assumptions in the current literature that the enhanced diffusion can be attributed primarily to an increase in vacancies, vacancy-assisted diffusion of isolated Si atoms was found to be an unfavorable mechanism for this group of semiconductor alloys. Our results show that new and highly mobile species that are created at high dopant concentration are instead responsible for the enhanced diffusion observed. Those new species include Si complexes such as Si-Si pairs and Si split interstitials which can move more easily within the crystal lattice. We use these DFT results to inform the development of a continuum model that addresses limitations in current models and shows great agreement with experimental results. We also develop a new method whereby machine learning in lieu of DFT, is used to predict forces during NEB simulations. This new method allows to compute transition pathways at a fraction of the cost while maintaining reasonable accuracy compared to the traditional DFT approach.		2/22/19	"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:32Z (GMT).

Given the global demand for female labor from developing countries, that many of these families are poor and cannot afford to migrate together, and that once separated reunification is further prolonged by immigration policies, many immigrant children are separated from a primary caregiver for some portion of their development.  This dissertation project compares the developmental outcomes of three groups of Caribbean immigrant children, one group of first-generation children who migrated with their mothers (family migration), another group of first-generation children who were separated from their mothers due to migration (separated migration), and a third group of second-generation children.  Studying maternal separation in immigration illuminates an important context in which child development occurs for some immigrant children.  Drawing support from the research on adverse childhood experiences, like childhood poverty, it is hypothesized that different immigration ecologies will engender different parent-child relations, mental health outcomes, and cognitive abilities.  Chapter two examines the attachment patterns of Caribbean immigrant adolescents and establishes a link between maternal separation in immigration and attachment anxiety.  Chapter three explores the role of attachment security and parenting styles on the mental health of Caribbean immigrant youth.  The results of this paper show that attachment security fully mediates the link between immigration experiences and mental health outcomes.  Chapter four proposes executive function as a potential explanatory variable for the academic disparities observed among immigrant youth.  Results show that children from the family migration group report better cognitive flexibility than the other two groups.  Results also show that parental involvement positively and significantly impacts executive function abilities.  Together, this dissertation provides evidence that maternal separation due to immigration is associated with some adverse child development outcomes.  The findings from this project are useful to families, educators, and policy-makers as work together to support this population.			"Made available in DSpace on 2018-10-22T18:48:33Z (GMT).

Our processing needs lie beyond just organizing photos by date and location. We need image analysis tools that can reason about photos like a human. For example, we need algorithms that can identify the people, activities, materials, illumination and 3D shapes depicted in photos. These scene understanding tasks are the key building blocks of many practical applications: automatic album creation & video summarization, intelligent sharing & privacy policies for social networks, automatic image captioning, visual question & answer, visual search & recommendation systems, acquisition of physical properties (e.g., reflectance and 3D shape), augmented reality object insertion, artistic stylization, smart photo manipulation, robot task planning and self-driving cars. The goal of scene understanding is to infer a structured model of reality from a photo. This cannot be done perfectly because there can be many realities which produce the same image. Humans excel at using prior experience to guess the reality which underlies an image. A new approach to scene understanding has grown around the idea that computers can mimic human-level scene understanding by fitting an artificial neural network to labeled image data. This approach is called deep learning and it is dramatically more successful than previous approaches. Deep learning can be summarized in three key steps: (1) acquire millions of labeled images; (2) create a multi-layer convolutional neural network (aka deep CNN) model parameterized by millions of variables; and (3) adjust the parameters so that the CNN predicts the same as a human. In this thesis we explore the three steps of deep learning through the lens of recognizing materials in a real-world scene and making structured changes to an image: we describe a practical method for efficiently gathering crowdsourced labels; a method for assigning a material label to every pixel of an image; a method for improving the accuracy of crowdsourced labels; and surprising new applications of CNNs for photorealistic image manipulation.

Private capital markets are a largely untapped resource that many argue can help support and sustain sustainable fisheries management. This paper explores this topic by analyzing the challenges and opportunities facing conservation finance, a growing industry seeking to balance financial returns with improvements to local environmental, economic, and social conditions. Using open access fisheries as context, we present the first application of a bioeconomic model to inform conservation finance for fisheries. We identify three strategies described by the conservation finance industry and evaluate their capacity to generate financial returns and to promote positive triple bottom-line impacts. Our model suggests that, in order for conservation finance to be effective, strong fisheries governance must first be established. If governance is not established, then  conservation finance is faced with a perverse incentive in which a conservation finance project can generate value and increase employment while depleting the stock biomass. The results also suggest a tradeoff between environmental and social outcomes for fisheries operating at open access: in order to promote the recovery of the fish stock, fishing effort must be reduced. This conflicts with the stated goals of conservation finance and the broader sustainable development community to promote sustainable natural resource use without impacting the livelihoods of local stakeholders.

We have a very poor understanding however, of the mechanisms that drive this limited elevational distribution in birds. In my dissertation, I investigated hypobaric hypoxia, interspecific competition and habitat loss as drivers of distribution in montane birds in the Himalayas. The first chapter is an introduction to the topic of elevational distribution in birds and the motivation behind the following chapters. In the second chapter we show that annual elevational movement patterns of Himalayan birds predict their strategy to cope with hypobaric hypoxia. We demonstrate that while elevational migrants increase hemoglobin concentration by increasing the volume of erythrocytes in their blood, sedentary high-elevation residents increase hemoglobin concentration by increasing mean cellular hemoglobin concentration in a comparative study of 15 passerine species. In the third chapter, I used song playback and feeder experiments to test the role of interspecific competition in driving the elevational distribution of green-backed and cinereous tits in the western Himalayas. I show that although green-backed tits are behaviorally dominant over cinereous tits, cinereous tits live at high elevations by occupying habitats vacated by green-backed tits. In the fourth chapter, I used the results from the behavioral experiments to predict the spatial distribution of cinereous and green-backed tits in a landscape. Using occupancy modeling, we show that green-backed tits are dependent on forests for breeding sites at their elevational lower distributional limit and might be adversely affected by habitat loss. Cinereous tits, a common low elevation species on the other hand, occupy human-modified habitats and are likely expanding their elevational range upslope due to anthropogenic habitat modifications. In the fifth chapter, we undertook the first population ecology study on the green-backed tit in the Himalayas. Using a genetic blind test, we show that green-backed tit males have broader breast stripes than females. We also show that males and females have different beak shapes in winter but there is no significant difference in beak shape in summer due to male beaks becoming shorter.

Much of these rising costs can be attributed to consolidation of health care providers, the provision of generous insurance plans, and innovations in medical technologies and pharmaceuticals. This dissertation studies how innovation in insurance plan design and pharmaceuticals affect health care prices, consumer behavior, consumer welfare, and the labor market. It also looks at whether certain policy interventions might lead to increased efficiency in these health care settings.
 
In the first chapter, I study employer incentives to offer narrow-network health plans to their enrollees, and the welfare effects of switching to these plans. To do so, I estimate a model of supply and demand for health insurance offered by a large benefits administrator in Massachusetts, where I endogenize the product menu offered to consumers with respect to hospital and physician networks. I then use these estimates to study how the employer's number of products, networks, premiums, and consumer welfare would respond to a hypothetical tax on expensive health plans, in the style of the ACA ""Cadillac Tax."" I find that consumers' plan choices are driven primarily by inertia rather than by the value of the plan's network, and that this inertia causes the employer to continue offering plans that add little value in a strict price-versus-provider-choice tradeoff. A 60% tax on health plans in excess of $6,000 annually would cause the employer to drop each of its broad plans in favor of more narrow-network products, resulting in an approximately 21% reduction in health spending, or $76 per-member-per-month (pmpm).  Consumer welfare from being moved to this new menu of products would decrease an average of $58 pmpm. I conclude that incentivizing employers to eliminate broad network products through a tax has the potential to increase social welfare. 
While broad-network insurance plans are one source of rising health costs, spending on pharmaceuticals has also increased over the last thirty years, accompanying large gains in life expectancy. The second chapter of this dissertation addresses the question of whether the spending on medical care has been worth the cost.  Using discrete choice methods from the industrial organization literature, I, along with coauthors Claudio Lucarelli and Sean Nicholson, construct a series of quality-adjusted price indices for colorectal cancer treatments, a condition for which the average price of treatment increased dramatically from 1993 to 2005, largely due to the approval and widespread use of five new drugs over that period.  Of note, we estimate a price index using parameters from a pure characteristics model, a demand technique which drops the idiosyncratic error term that produces undesirable switching patterns in traditional logit models. We find that the naive price index for these treatments greatly overstates the true price increase.  In contrast, indices that account for the fact that consumers value the quality gains from pharmaceutical innovation show much more modest price increases.  We also find that the magnitude of the price increase varies with modeling assumptions. Traditional logit models tend to overstate the value of product innovation, whereas the pure characteristics model implies a more substantial price increase.  These results suggest the importance of modeling assumptions when constructing quality-adjusted indices. 
Chapter 3 turns its focus to the labor market, and examines the effects of state mandated health benefits on job transitions and job separations.  Specifically, it looks at variation in state mental health parity legislation throughout the 1990s and 2000s to assess whether the addition of a high-cost benefit mandate has led to any significant displacement effect or treatment effect.  While prior studies on mental health parity have focused primarily on health outcomes and the probability of having insurance following a mandate, few have paid attention to labor market outcomes.  Those that did primarily reported the effects on levels of employment, ignoring potential effects on job flows.   I exploit state variation in mandate passage by using restricted-access data from the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS).  The state identifiers in this data allow me to estimate changes in both employment and job transitions for the population most likely impacted by mental health mandates:  employees with previously held mental health diagnoses.  Finally, I provide initial estimates of the effect of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 on these labor market outcomes.  I find that mental health parity has had little effect on employment levels, consistent with prior literature, but has caused a decrease in job separations, primarily employment to employment transitions.  I present evidence that at least a third of this decline comes from a reduction in involuntary transitions, implying that mental health parity has a positive effect for individuals with untreated illnesses. In addition, I find that mandates led to increased expenditures for mental health services, further suggesting that the involuntary decline was likely due to a treatment effect of the mandates."			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:44Z (GMT).

Although the addition of various nanofillers makes them viable for high-tech applications, the control of spatial distribution and orientation of functional nanoinclusions remains a great challenge. There is a plethora of methods for nanoparticle surface modification to improve the enthalpic interaction between the polymer matrix and the filler, but often it results in deterioration of catalytic, magnetic and electrical properties of the composites. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a reliable and scalable method for the control of dispersion of nanoinclusions in polymer nanocomposites, without compromising their fundamental properties. 
The work presented in this thesis aims to investigate the effect of additional extensional deformation provided by a sheath layer of controlled air flow during gas-assisted electrospinning (GAES) and air-controlled electrospray (ACES) on dispersion and spatial orientation of various nanoparticles in polymer matrix. Both spherical and anisotropic nanoparticles were employed in this study.  First, we developed a robust post-process methodology to analyze transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of microtomed longitudinal sections of nanoparticle-loaded PVA nanofibers, which provides a unique opportunity to investigate the details of the deformation-induced dispersion behavior. To demonstrate the material application perspective, we utilized GAES in the fabrication of a fibrous silicon anode material for Li-ion batteries, and observed a significant enhancement in both capacity and activity of active nanoinclusions at the same composition, which is attributed to improved dispersion. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics study confirms these experimental observations. 
We further extended our knowledge to conventional electrospray and novel air-controlled electrospray methods, to overcome the limitations due to non-uniform deposition and poor dispersion of fillers in functional coatings. Due to the precise control of atomization via extensional deformation and viscoelasticity, we successfully utilized new spraying processes for coatings with precisely controllable nanoscale topology, morphology, deposition thickness, and spatial distribution of unfunctionalized nanoinclusions. In order to demonstrate the industrial potential, we employed air-controlled electrospray for mass-production of micro/nano-scale encapsulates, and further fabrication of polymer composites with in situ indication of mechanical damage.
Finally, to overcome scalability constraints and ensure viability for industrial utilization, we investigated a novel centrifugal spinning process. The focus was on the experimental visualization of the fluid flow and examination of the effects of viscoelasticity, polymer flow rate and driving force on the initial thinning and the contour shaper and radii of the polymer jet. High-speed camera imaging was utilized to visualize the flow of viscoelastic Boger fluid during centrifugal spinning process, and experimental results including intital jetting behavior were compared with the simulation results predicted by the discretized modeling. 
The current work provides an array of robust, economic and efficient single-step methods to fabricate hierarchical nanocomposites with controllable functionalities, topologies, morphologies, and spatial distribution of active nanoinclusions. The added benefit of experimental visualization and further comparison with computer simulation provides valuable insights and more rigorous understanding of the process.  The successful advancement and utilization of these novel techniques will offer more comprehensive studies of nanocompsoites and lead to the next-generation functional materials."

Village groves, which can be considered as cases of human and nature interactions, are common in the rural landscape of Korea, but also vulnerable to rapid social-ecological changes. Considering village groves‚Äô historical, cultural, and ecological values, better management and policy tools are needed to face the challenges brought by constantly recurring disturbances and increased human pressures and to guide toward more resilient social-ecological village groves systems.
I first reviewed the literature on community forestry and related adaptive capacity in three East Asian countries, China, Japan, and Korea, to understand Korean village groves in the context of community forestry and to investigate the indicators of adaptive capacity along with disturbances in this region. Through a systematic review, I addressed the role of diverse knowledge systems, such as traditional and Western scientific knowledge, and civic traditions of self-organization in local communities that characterized adaptive capacity of this region.   
Second, I explored the role of social learning for social-ecological resilience in the four village groves restoration projects using multiple-case studies. In applying the framework of social learning processes and outcomes to Korean cases, I found that multiple elements of social learning, including interaction, systems orientation, integration, and reflection, were present, but did not always lead to desired management outcomes viewed through the lens of multiple-loop learning.
Third, I investigated how local people, their relational structures and functional roles in networks contributed to the development of adaptive co-management of village groves. Through a qualitative network analysis, I described the social relations of local people in four village groves restoration projects and multiple functions of bridging organizations that helped local people to achieve conservation outcomes and to improve village grove governance processes with multiple stakeholders, while contributing to emergent adaptive co-management. 
This dissertation shows how local efforts to restore village groves can change village groves from cultural landscapes to dynamic social-ecological systems. In this process, the fact that local people can serve not just as simple stewards, but also as agents of change for resilient village groves may provide implications for local resource management under similar conditions."			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:42Z (GMT).

Hair is an important part of our appearance, and we wear and use clothes made from various types of fibers.  Computer graphics models that can accurately simulate light scattering in these materials have applications in the production of media such as movies and video games.  They can also significantly lower the cost of textile design by allowing designers to design fabrics entirely in silico, render realistic images for feedback, and then fabricate final products that look exactly as designed.
Recent research has shown that renderings of the highest quality---those showing realistic reflectance and complex geometric details---can be obtained by modeling individual fibers.  However, this approach raises many open problems.  For hair, the effect of fiber cross sections on light scattering behavior has never been carefully studied.  For textiles, several competing approaches for fiber-level modeling exist, and it has been unclear which is the best.  Furthermore, there has been no general procedure for matching textile models to real fabric appearance, and rendering such models requires considerable computing resources.  In this dissertation, we present solutions to these open problems.
Our first contribution is a light scattering model for human hair fibers that more accurately takes into account how light interacts with their elliptical cross sections.  The model has been validated by a novel measurement device that captures light scattered from a single hair fiber much more efficiently than previous methods.
Our second contribution is a general and powerful optimization framework for estimating parameters of a large class of appearance models from observations of real materials, which greatly simplifies development and testing of such models.  We used the framework to systematically identify best practices in fabric modeling, including how to represent geometry and which light scattering model to use for textile fibers.
Our third contribution is a fast, precomputation-based, GPU-friendly algorithm for approximately rendering fiber-level textile models under environment illumination.  Using only a single commodity GPU, our implementation can render high-resolution, supersampled images of micron-resolution fabrics with multiple scattering in tens of seconds, compared to tens of core-hours required by CPU-based algorithms.  Our algorithm makes fiber-level models practical for applications that require quick feedback, such as interactive textile design.  
We expect these contributions will make realistic physically-based virtual prototyping a reality."					"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:36Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This dissertation investigates two building blocks of network dataplane programming for network devices: the packet processing pipeline and network device interface. In the first part of the dissertation, we show that designing packet processing pipelines on hardware can be fast and flexible (programmable). A network dataplane compiler and runtime is presented that generates a custom FPGA dataplane designed and built from a dataplane programming language called P4 (programming protocol independent packet processors). P4FPGA generates designs that can be synthesized to either Xilinx or Altera FPGAs. We have benchmarked several representative P4 programs, and the experiments show that code generated by P4FPGA runs at line-rate at all packet sizes with latencies comparable to commercial ASICs. In the second part of the dissertation, we present a programmable network interface for the net- work dataplane. We show that a software programmable physical layer (programmable PHY) can capture and control the timing of physical layer bits with sub-nanosecond precision greatly increasing precision in network measurements. The benefits of a pro- grammable PHY is demonstrated with an available bandwidth estimation algorithm and a decentralized clock synchronization protocol that provides bounded precision where no two clocks differ by more than tens of nanoseconds.

While there is a rich literature from epidemiology and economics that quantify the mortality risk of air pollution, the morbidity impact of air pollution especially in developing countries is not well understood. This paper examines both the short- and long-term impacts of PM2.5 on morbidity based on daily card spending in hospitals and drugstores in nearly 300 cities. To address the potential endogeneity in air pollution, we construct an IV by leveraging the spatial spillovers of air pollution due to long-range transport. Our analysis shows that PM2.5 has significant impacts on health spending in both short term (within a week) and longer term (within three months).  A reduction of 10 ug/m3 in daily PM2.5 could lead to a total annual savings of at least 75 billion yuan($11 billion) in health spending in China.

We aim at investigating what are the factors that potentially motivate a healthy individual who is free from CD (celiac disease) and NCGS (non-celiac gluten sensitivity) to follow a gluten-free diet. The empirical analysis of our experiment suggests that the provision of additional information regarding to gluten-free products has an impact on consumers' preferences of following a gluten-free diet. Additionally, the analysis indicates that consumers' preferences of following a gluten-free diet can be influenced by their personal characteristics (reading habits, family background, etc) and any cognitive distortions (overgeneralization bias, herd behavior, etc) they might have. Lastly, the paper discusses how following a gluten-free diet is correlated with consumers' future food consuming behaviors. The results imply that consumers are more willing to try and accept a brand-new food diet if they already followed a gluten-free diet.					"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:37Z (GMT).

This landscape was formed by indigenous processes at the ‚Äòperiphery‚Äô of colonial control where the effects of colonial military actions variably affected Seneca communities. Within the context of the 200-year Seneca site sequence, my material analyses focus on identification of archaeologically-recovered charcoal from three sites‚ÄîGanondagan, White Springs, and Townley-Read‚Äîsuccessively occupied by the same community under variable political and economic conditions (ca. 1670‚Äì1754 CE).  Finding strong evidence for contextually different uses of wood and forms of Seneca landscape stewardship, I conclude that that the Seneca community maintained and re-created certain kinds of relationships with the landscape through a period of difficulty and change. This research emphasizes the agentive action of Haudenosaunee people and highlights the necessity of addressing the role of past human-landscape processes in shaping not only environments encountered by early colonial figures but also those we live with today.			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:36Z (GMT).

Internal strategies include those that give subsidiary managers greater discretion to fit their human resource (HR) practices to local norms. External strategies include networking strategies with external stakeholders designed to access local information and develop relationships of trust that facilitate doing business in new environments. Drawing on a sample of Chinese MNCs operating in the U.S., I show that both localization strategies provide important means to overcome liabilities of foreignness and origin and contribute to subsidiary growth. The extent of adoption of these strategies, however, reflects not only strategic considerations, but also institutional pressures from host and home countries. Host country regulatory pressures appear to induce network building, but home country institutions (the relative level of state ownership) are associated with lower devolution of HRM and network building to subsidiary managers, suggesting efforts to exert centralized control.

The first is how to analyze annual maximum series (AMS) with maxima from two or more distinct processes (e.g. rainfall and snowmelt). The second is how one might incorporate climate change trends into flood risk models.
The mixed-population flood-risk estimators considered include a joint model that includes correlation between rainfall and snowmelt events, a mixture model that treats the two as independent, and an AMS model. The mixture estimator is simple and the most efficient when the complete series of both events are available and the log-cross-correlation is 0.5 or less. When the rainfall distribution dominants the large flood risk, using just the rainfall flood distribution works well. We explore a Kirby-estimator and an Expected Moments Algorithm (EMA) for situations when only the AMS is available. Kirby used the conditional distributions for snowmelt and for rainfall given they are the annual maximum for their year. EMA employs a censored sampling paradigm to represent each data series. EMA generally performs better than the Kirby estimator. 
A fundamental assumption of FFA is that flood series are stationary. This thesis evaluates FFA methods that might be used when flood records have trends due to climate change. We consider six estimators. The ‚ÄúStationary‚Äù estimator retains the time-invariance assumption and employs the AMS. Possible methods with time-varying parameters are represented by 3 estimators: Trend_0 uses the true trends in the AMS mean and variance; Trend_1 estimates the trend in the mean of the log-AMS; Trend_2 estimates trends in both the mean and the variance of the log-AMS. ‚Äú30-year record‚Äù is the ‚ÄúStationary‚Äù estimator using only the most recent 30 years of data. ‚ÄúSafety factor‚Äù increases or decreases the 100-year flood estimator by a prescribed percentage. With modest trends (‚â§ ¬±0.25% per year), the stationary estimator works well for short records (n=40), but is inferior to Trend_1 with larger trends. With longer records (n=100), Trend_1 performs well for most cases except when the trend in both the mean and variance was ¬±1%, when Trend_2 is a good alternative. FFA in a dynamic world is a challenge."					"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:36Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

A notable example of this is Graph Cuts, in which the minimum-cut problem is used to solve a class of vision problems known as first-order Markov Random Fields. Despite this success, first-order MRFs have their limitations. They cannot encode correlations between groups of pixels larger than two or easily express higher-order statistics of images. In this thesis, we generalize graph cuts to higher-order MRFs, while still maintaining the properties that make graph cuts successful.
In particular, we will examine three different mathematical techniques which have combined to make previously intractable higher-order inference problems become practical within the last few years. First, order-reducing reductions, which transform higher-order problems into familiar first-order MRFs. Second, a generalization of the min-cut problem to hypergraphs, called Sum-of-Submodular optimization. And finally linear programming relaxations based on the Local Marginal Polytope, which together with Sum-of-Submodular flow results in the highly effective primal-dual algorithm SoSPD.
This thesis presents all mathematical background for these algorithms, as well as an implementation and experimental comparison with state-of-the-art."					"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:35Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Specifically, we consider the fundamental issue of determining the appropriate fleet size from operational perspectives. In this study, we model and analyze the AMoD system, whereby all modes of personal transportation in a city are replaced by one centralized controlled fleet of automated vehicles. A framework which integrates traffic assignment, vehicles routing and automated vehicles rebalancing is provided to estimate fleet size. Experimental results, based on simulations, are provided using actual demand data obtained from NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission. Results reveal that in midtown Manhattan during weekday morning peak hours, an AMoD fleet whose size is 63% of that currently in operation can satisfy all travel demands with the passenger waiting time less than 6 minutes.

Recently, rising awareness of climate change has spurred many analyses on the cost of such change from various channels. Using a disaggregated approach, this paper examines the nonlinear impact of warming temperature on twenty economic sectors, meanwhile accounting for heterogeneity in the responses. The results suggest that, while most sectors will incur a loss under different scenarios of climate change, the aggregated impact on the entire United States economy is moderate.

The goal is to develop a deeper understanding of factors that drive a Mexican worker to join the informal sector. I utilize the Mexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS) to test the relationship between informality and gender, relationship status, age, place of residence, educational attainment, job type, income, firm size, and violence. I find that younger, unmarried women and men with lower levels of education living in small rural towns and working in the service sector have the highest propensity to work informally. Additionally, formality is concentrated in lower income groups and smaller firms and older, married men that are not in non-service sector jobs tend to work in formal positions regardless of firm size. Finally, I find violent assault experience does not have a significant relationship with working the informal sector. 
Chapter 2 expands empirical literature regarding labor law violation and compliance by identifying violation rates for the case of Uruguay. The analysis is then extended using a labor market adaptation of Alkire-Foster multidimensional poverty measurement. I find that labor law violation has progressively decreased since 2002, laborers who have low education, live in rural areas, are black, and work in small firms are more likely to face labor violations, and workers are more likely to experience violations in labor dimensions outside of minimum wage. These findings open a rich research agenda concerning labor law violation rates, enforcement resources, and informality."					"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:37Z (GMT).

Bacterial spores and the sexual spores of some filamentous fungi are the two most thermostable food-relevant propagules. Ascospores, hyphae, yeast cells, and conidia are each uniquely adept for dispersal in the production environment, while aciduric, thermophilic bacterial spore formers can survive and propagate under prototypical processing and storage conditions. Therefore, the goal of this project was to characterize the prevalence of microbial food spoilage incidents, identify the production conditions which select for particular spoilage organisms, and develop practices and controls to minimize the likelihood and severity of spoilage incidents. A survey of over 50 fruit and vegetable juice manufacturers revealed that 64% of respondents had faced quality threats from heat resistant molds and 78% were concerned with Alicyclobacillus spoilage. The vast majority (90%) of manufacturers indicated better control over microbial spoilage would increase profits and reduce waste. A prediction model was developed from an observational study assessing the ecology of fungi isolated from spoiled products submitted by industry collaborators.  The outcomes at terminal nodes following recursive partitioning were included if they represented a ‚â•15% probability, which resulted in a decision tree with actionable outcomes for industry. Two examples from this collection of observations were explored further. Mucor circinelloides spoilage of yogurt was characterized under different thermal treatments, incubation conditions, and preservative regimes. Depending on a company‚Äôs control over sanitation programs and degree of risk aversion, maintenance of the cold chain or variable amounts of natamycin (>10 ppm) were determined to be sufficient intervention strategies to minimize spoilage from this post-processing, dimorphic contaminant. The spoilage potential variability of a collection of 53 food-sourced Alicyclobacillus isolates was also evaluated in various model systems. Citric acid was determined to significantly reduce the synthesis of guaiacol, the causative spoilage metabolite, which was produced variably across species from differing isolation sources. Collectively, these results may be useful in the development of in-plant quality controls and the selection of targets in validation and challenge studies.			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:36Z (GMT).

The purpose of this research is to investigate the team dynamics associated with team flexibility in an effort to understand whether such concerns may be merited.  Using data collected from 99 teams in a U.S.-based Fortune 500 company, I develop and test a model that examines the effects of team location flexibility on multiple forms of team communication and their subsequent impact on idea generation and innovation.  Specifically, I investigate whether informal ‚Äúwater cooler‚Äù communication is a uniquely important predictor of idea generation and, critically, whether teams in which members work more flexibly are at a greater risk of missing out on these types of interactions.  Based on a series of team-level regression analyses supplemented by relative weights analyses, I find that teams with greater location flexibility reported engaging less frequently in two forms of face-to-face informal communication: face-to-face spontaneous work-related communication, and to a lesser extent, face-to-face non-work-related communication. However, teams did not engage less frequently in face-to-face formal communication.  Moreover, I find that the type of communication most affected by team location flexibility‚Äîface-to-face spontaneous work-related communication‚Äîis also the type that has the greatest impact on team idea generation and, consequently, team innovation.  Finally, I find evidence that teams were unable to effectively compensate for the loss of face-to-face informal communication by using electronic media, such as email, instant message, or audio/visual communication tools.  Taken together, I find that an important type of innovation-related communication is reduced when teams work more flexibly.  Future research that builds on these findings is needed, as managers and organizations weigh the potential trade-offs between the benefits of flexible work arrangements for individual employees with the drawbacks of flexibility for teams‚Äîparticularly on their ability to innovate in unexpected and unplanned ways at the office.			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:37Z (GMT).

It is the second largest of the Finger Lakes (New York, USA), with a long narrow shape. Concerns exist regarding the lake‚Äôs phosphorus and turbidity loadings, specifically on the southern shelf (also where three point sources discharge: two waste water treatment plants and Cornell‚Äôs Lake Source Cooling Facility). Cayuga Inlet, along with Fall Creek, flow into the southern end and account for 40% of the total inflow to the entire lake. Studies indicate Cayuga Inlet and Fall Creek account for 87% of the bioavailable phosphorus load specifically entering in the southern shelf. A number of complex physical processes establish exchange and transport between the lake and the inlet. Understanding which mechanisms control transport of loadings is essential to evaluating the processes that govern water quality. 
Using data collected over the summer and fall months in 2015 and 2016 along Cayuga Inlet, from the inflowing tributaries, through the inlet, and out to the southern lake, we examine various physical mechanisms and their influence on turbidity loads. Velocity profiles in Cayuga Inlet are captured with an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and High Resolution (HR) acoustic Doppler Profiler (ADP), and turbulence measures with an acoustic Dopper velocimeter (ADV). Water quality sondes are used to monitor turbidity and temperature along with a widely-distributed set of thermistors to obtain a detailed description of temperature structures throughout the area of interest. Data from United States Geographical Survey (USGS) gage stations as well as local meteorological stations are utilized to more fully understand forcing mechanisms important to flow behavior in Cayuga Inlet.
Our results suggest flow through Cayuga Inlet is continuously influenced by barotropic seiches in Cayuga Lake while occasional large baroclinic events occur, the largest of which transport lake water into Cayuga Inlet. Over the stratified season exchange flows are typical and largely forced by temperature differences between the tributaries and southern lake bounding the inlet. The predominant wind stress is along the axis of the lake and the inlet and sets up seiching behavior in the lake which influences  flow behavior in the inlet. A strong wind stress also increases vertical mixing in the inlet. Minimal sediment resuspension occurs in the inlet and generally, the inlet is a conduit through which suspended sediment is advected. The tributaries carry significant turbidity loads into the inlet during runoff events, which in two layer flows under conditions of cooler tributary temperatures relative to the inlet and southern lake, typically appear in the lower layer. In the spring, when the southern lake is expected to be cooler than that observed over the summer and fall deployment periods analyzed here and tributary flows are expected to warm faster, significant turbidity loads may pass through the top layer of the inlet with more frequency. At times turbidity loads in the southern lake are transported by seiching back into the inlet and again in two layer flows typically appear in the appropriate stratified layer based on the southern lake temperature relative to the inlet and tributaries."

Although DSGE models are widely used in macroeconomics and finance, no statistically sound estimation methods for policy functions such as the price-dividend ratio function have been developed. Because they rely on a fully specified data generating process (DGP) of state variables, numerical solution methods, extensively adopted in the literature, may discredit model evaluation due to model misspecification of state variables and poor approximations of unknown functions. 
In the second chapter, I propose a convenient nonparametric 2SLS series regression method that is built on consumption based asset pricing models (CAPM), and we investigate its performance in comparison with analytic and existing numerical solutions. The new method proposes to estimate a recursively specified function embedded in Euler equations always admits a data-based closed-form solution, and it is not only easy to implement but also asymptotically free of endogeneity biases and approximation errors, even when the CAPM becomes complex. This new method does not require specifying a DGP of state variables, which avoids model misspecification of state variables and enables us to connect the solutions of DSGE models to empirical data. Our method always provides a consistent estimation of the price-dividend ratio function for a broad class of stationary Markov state variables. The newly proposed 2SLS series regression method will become a pivotal approach for obtaining a consistent estimation of the price-dividend ratio function in the presence of a misspecified or unknown DGP of state variables, and it can help construct the most reliable and accurate model implications. 
In the third chapter, I consider dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models (DSGE) with recursive preferences, which provide powerful means for investigating the connection between economic fundamentals, asset returns and agent preferences. A system of Euler equations is derived as a pivotal tool to obtain model implications. It often involves multiple recursively specified unknown functions of state variables over different time periods, such as the price-dividend ratio function and the wealth-consumption ratio function. Given the fact that analytic solutions are extremely difficult, if not impossible, numerical solution methods for such functions are extensively adopted in the literature. Because cross dependence exists among unknown functions, all existing numerical solution methods can only provide function approximations sequentially. Therefore, approximation errors from one solution may accumulate and contaminate the others, thereby resulting in conflicting model conclusions. Despite this importance, no statistically sound methods that provide estimation and inference on this class of multiple unknown functions have been developed. Built upon the Epstein and Zin's (1989) consumption based asset pricing model (CAPM), we propose a new nonparametric generalized method of moments (GMM) series procedure and investigate its performance in comparison with existing numerical solution methods. Instead of approximating unknown functions sequentially, our method can consistently estimate all unknown functions simultaneously, while capturing their interactions using the variance-covariance of the derived estimators. Moreover, our GMM series approach is asymptotically free of simultaneous equation biases, endogeneity biases and functional form misspecification as the sample size increases, no matter how complex the DSGE model is. In addition, compared to all existing numerical solution methods which can only provide function approximations given a fully specified dynamics of state variables, our nonparametric GMM series procedure does not require any specification for the dynamics of state variables, thus avoiding potential misspecification for the data generating process (DGP) of state variables. To incorporate a wide variety of empirically relevant setups, this paper discusses two types of the GMM series estimators, namely the two-stage and continuously updating efficient (CUE) GMM series estimators. Our nonparametric CUE GMM series estimator will improve accuracy of inference when instruments are weakly correlated with Euler equation errors. Because there is an infinite number of moments due to series approximations, our nonparametric GMM series method contributes to the GMM literature by establishing a new result on consistency and asymptotic normality, which further helps facilitate rigorous inference on the DSGE model implications. Three simulation studies are considered, and our new method has been proven to perform reasonably well in the finite sample in comparison with popular numerical solution methods such as the log linearization, discretization and projection methods.
In the fourth chapter, investor extrapolation biases in the dynamics of economic fundamental variables are introduced into the traditional Lucas Jr (1978) consumption-based asset pricing models (CAPM). Given the involvement of subjective expectations in the estimation procedure, this paper proposes a feasible generalized method of moments (GMM) approach to provide consistent estimation of model parameters. Using this new estimation method, we discover different patterns of investor extrapolation biases for local investors in China, the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom. Investors in U.S., Japan and U.K. tend to react to changes in the mean levels of economic fundamentals, whereas investors in China only pay extra attention to the overall volatile levels of the aggregate economic background. Once equipped with their specific estimated extrapolation biases, models for all these four countries show good performance in explaining well-documented economic anomalies, such as the equity premium puzzle and accumulative equity returns for the aggregate stock markets. Different types of distorted investor beliefs identified in this paper help understand why China's stock market has been deviating from economic fundamentals in recent years. These distorted investor beliefs also shed light on how the regulation of China's stock market can be improved."			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:37Z (GMT).

This thesis looks at the life and practice of photographer Lionel Wendt (1900-1944). Wendt had a brief but prolific career as a photographer in the 1930s in the island then known as Ceylon, today known as Sri Lanka. His practice corresponds to a time in which the idea of what it meant to be from, and of, the nation of Ceylon was called into question as the island moved closer to independence from British rule. I situate my approach to Wendt‚Äôs photographs through this new imagining, and aim to bring his practice in conversation with the island‚Äôs social history from the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. My approach begins with Wendt‚Äôs role as leader of a forming avant-garde in Ceylon and how his practice as a photographer arose out of his interest in global modernist discourses and modes of cultural production in Ceylon. I also look to how Wendt‚Äôs photographs circulated, and the context and conditions of production that surround his photographs. Finally, I bring Wendt‚Äôs ‚ÄúSurrealist‚Äù aesthetic into question and expand on this categorization to account for his engagement with the Surrealist movement through discourse, in addition to his formal and aesthetic engagement. Rather than understand Wendt through a recognizable aesthetic and style, I seek to unpack the social aesthetics of his work. That is, how do Wendt‚Äôs photographs speak to the social, political and cultural conditions in which they were produced. The difficulty in bringing new readings to Wendt‚Äôs work arises from the limited access to his photographs, which are dispersed across private collections, out-of-print publications, and journals located in the depths of the archive. My access to this archive is also limited, but I do not seek to provide a comprehensive overview or understanding of his work. Instead, I use the social history surrounding Wendt‚Äôs practice to demonstrate how his photographs resist a singular meaning and can thus be subjected to multiple readings. These readings coexist and conflict with one another, which is itself an expression and reflection of their modernity and the conditions of their production."			5/30/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:40Z (GMT).

It can give innovative companies the opportunity to go beyond national boundaries, but at the same time can jeopardize their innovations without proper protection. In order to solve the problem of costs, delay, uncertainty, and unpredictability that fragmented patent system has caused, it has been argued that the harmonization of domestic patent laws is necessary. Countries have responded this by successfully concluding Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). International communities have particularly focused on harmonizing procedural issues to share administrative works of search and examination. This work-sharing mechanism is effective in alleviating works of patent offices and reducing application costs, which can consequentially contribute to improving patent quality.
  However, there have been growing conflicts around substantive harmonization. Developing countries argue that the benefits of patent harmonization was unevenly distributed, and resist further development of international patent laws. Historically, patent harmonization was discussed on the foundation of utilitarian theory. As a result, it was negotiated within the trade forum where countries can discuss compensation for Kaldor-Hicks improvement. However, the compensation mechanism of trade concession has not worked properly, and the relationship between trade and intellectual property (IP) is vague and tenuous at best. Thus, there is growing belief among developing countries that the international patent system is a coerced agreement that should be resisted rather than embraced.
  In this situation, it is necessary to consider delinking patent harmonization from trade negotiation. Rather than depending on utilitarian calculation, it is worth adopting property theories as a normative justification for further harmonization. Among many property theories, Locke‚Äôs labor theory can deliver balanced guidance by highlighting the natural-rights aspects of property, as well as recognizing a role of government. This fundamental paradigm shift of patent harmonization from the trade theory to property theories can provide a normative guidance to confront current issues in international intellectual property laws, such as biotechnology, traditional knowledge, and biodiversity."			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:37Z (GMT).

A quasi-experiment was conducted to test the hypotheses. In the experiment, three conditions were set up in a waiting room of a clinic, comprised of two positive distractions and a control. The first condition introduced a video of an aquarium into the room. The second introduced an interactive aquarium game that a waiting patient can interact with via a tablet. A third condition, in which TV news played on a TV in the background (as is the norm in the waiting room), was used as the control. Surveys were distributed to collect patient response on perceived wait time, perceived quality of care, and anxiety level. Receptionists and nurses coordinated to collect patients‚Äô actual wait times. Behavioral observation was conducted to provide more objective data (e.g. patients‚Äô actual activities while waiting). There were 408 patients who finished the survey, with 72 hours of behavioral observation conducted in total. The results partly support the hypotheses. DBPA was influenced by the interventions, and patient stress level was influenced by the perception of wait time. Perceived quality of care was correlated with a patient‚Äôs anxiety level. Based on the results, I suggest that DBPA might be a stronger indicator of a patient stress level than actual or perceived wait time, and that DBPA could be influenced by positive distraction.

This project focuses on the study of current food movements and the interpretations of local cuisines from the perspective of main agents involved (chefs, stakeholders, state agents, policy makers, researchers, independent organizations of producers, and consumers) in Colombia. In my analysis of different interpretations of Colombian culinary traditions and the discourses that are weaved from them, not necessarily as part of the same network but rather as part of the same cultural umbrella and national reality, I look at the what to do and how to protect these traditions in the torrent of innovating trends.  
Cooking responds to this double entendre of a past that is collected, interpreted and then projected on to a present that then overcomes it. New food trends necessarily imply questions about social and cultural equality and identity. That which is novel is exciting and refreshing; it implies learning and broadening boundaries, which are often geographical and social and always cultural. However, the process also entails the inherent challenge to define and answer what is lost and valued in a new scenario and to understand to what purpose.  Some categories that have been used to understand such historical processes of cultural production in social systems are class, race, ethnicity and gender, as well as concepts associated with territory, differentiation, integration and democratization, authenticity and exoticization. 
My purpose in conducting an analytical approach to the development of the gastronomical and culinary subject in Colombia and of building a diagnostic map of it, responds to the wish to contribute to the understanding of the function of food research in solving specific questions of inequality, estrangement, and deracination, as well as understanding new senses of belonging and appropriation that emerge because of urban reconfigurations."

Both instruments have unusual sound qualities, which have relegated their typical musical usage to effects or gimmicks. Thus, even though they are both ubiquitous in some way‚Äî within orchestral repertoire and in daily life, respectively‚Äîthe celesta and the balloon have not received significant scholarly attention thus far. 
‚ÄúBetween Worlds‚Äù  explores the celesta‚Äôs historical origins, physical mechanism, and musical idioms. Behind its beloved, sparkling sound, the instrument contains many complexities. Mechanically, it combines features of keyboard and percussion, occupying a no-man‚Äôs land in terms of classification and performance technique. The sonic identity and poetic implications of the celesta are inspired by a nineteenth century marvel, the music box.  As a result, its sound has taken on cultural associations, becoming a signifier for the magical, supernatural, and uncanny. Discussion of several works spanning from the eighteenth to twenty-first century demonstrate the varied ways in which composers interact with the instrument‚Äôs rich tradition.
‚ÄúActs of Envelopment‚Äù is a discussion of Judy Dunaway‚Äôs work for latex balloons as a comprehensively tactile approach to music-making. She has transformed the balloon into flexible and sonically diverse instrument, developing a range of performance techniques as well as specialized notation methods. Her pieces‚Äî whether they are solo improvisations, Fluxus-style events, or sound installations‚Äî are informed by the physical properties of sound and the resulting bodily sensations that it creates. For Dunaway, each performance is an act of envelopment, both physically and metaphorically. Turning away from the object‚Äôs traditional associations with parties and humor, Dunaway‚Äôs balloon practice is also a powerful political statement that expresses her feminist views. Her singular focus on this instrument is a unique contribution to American experimentalism."					"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:39Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The clock is important for cell cycle regulation and genome integrity. Disrupting the internal circadian clock can cause depression, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and even cancer. Importantly, circadian clocks are highly conserved among eukaryotes. Thus, we decided to focus on the well-characterized model systems- fungus¬†Neurospora crassa and fly¬†Drosophila melanogaster to study the structural properties of the interacting circadian clock components. These clock components make up the positive and negative arms of the circadian oscillators. The¬†Neurospora crassa¬†circadian clock consists of a positive regulator White Collar Complex (WCC) that activates the transcription of clock gene frequency. Frequency (FRQ) acts as a repressor in the negative arm of the oscillator. FRQ acts as a repressor by binding with its partner Casein Kinase 1 (CK1) to phosphorylate and inactivate WCCs. Similar to FRQ, the¬†Drosophila¬†circadian clock is composed of a repressor Period (PER) that phosphorylates and inactivates Drosophila positive activators. While many biochemical and genetic studies have explored the functional aspects of the circadian clock components, very little is known about the mechanisms of the interactions with each other. Therefore, an analogous study of the components in both model systems would provide better understanding of the respective protein structures and interactions. In this thesis, we show that the N. crassa WCC can recognize and tightly bind to frq promoter regions in the absence of WC1 photosensor domain. Secondly, N. crassa repressor FRQ is stabilized and phosphorylated if co-purified with binding partner CK1. Additionally, FRQ:CK1 has a more flexible conformation when it is hyperphosphorylated. Lastly, like FRQ, repressor PER in D. melanogaster, is stabilized by phosphorylation on specific sites. This shows structural similarities between these two repressors FRQ and PER. These results provide a deeper understanding of the molecular bases of the circadian clocks in N. crassa and D. melanogaster to pave way for future structural studies of many eukaryotic clock proteins.

I am a pragmatist at heart -- most concerned with how best to achieve society's goals with limited resources -- but no policy exists in a vacuum, and so I cherish the contributions of economic theory in helping us to understand the complex ways that our policies fit into and shape existing institutions. 
My first essay, ``The Role of Fiscal Impacts in the Public School Response to Charter Competition,'' embodies my philosophy that policy research be rigorous and data driven while being shaped by economic thinking. Charter schools are a topic of great interest in education policy, and the effects of charter schools on their own students have been closely examined. By the nature of their limited capacity, however, the main role charter schools play in reforming education must be to shape the behavior of the public school system. My work aims to improve our understanding of the little-studied effects of charter competition on the reallocation of traditional public schools' resources. 
To the extent that existing work considers competition between charter schools and the traditional public school system, it implicitly assumes a uniform competitive pressure: losing more students to charter schools elicits a greater response from public schools. However, public schools are diverse institutions bound by tradition and history rather than the optimizing behavior that disciplines private firms in competitive markets -- and the state mechanisms that fund and regulate education are generally not rationalized to promote competition. In my first essay, I demonstrate that public schools' responses to charter competition display heterogeneity along a second dimension; districts that are more fiscally constrained by unavoidable costs are correspondingly muted in the degree to which they reallocate resources, even in the face of large losses of students. I make the case that in evaluating the effects of charter schools or school choice policies more generally, we must consider the degree to which public schools are willing and able to respond; a well-designed school education reform policy must provide both the means and the incentive to reform.
In ``An Evaluation of the Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship's Effect on PhD production at Non-UNCF institutions'', joint with Sarah J. Prenovitz, Ronald G. Ehrenberg and George H. Jakubson, I study the effects of a high-profile fellowship program for under-represented minority students on the educational attainment of its beneficiaries. Evaluating this program presents two major challenges: first, we do not observe PhDs in progress. Second, the program was not designed for evaluation, and never collected the kind of rich data on individuals now used in many administrative settings. By obtaining data on the completions of all PhDs over a period of several decades, we estimate distributions of time-to-degree and use those to build projections of the PhDs that will eventually be completed from each undergraduate class. We also use the staggered inclusion of participating institutions into the fellowship program to obtain a counterfactual estimate of the program's effect. In the end we find no causal effect of the program on the educational attainment of its participants; although the rates of PhD completion are high outside of a causal analysis, the program may be targeted towards those students who are already most likely to complete doctoral degrees. 
My final chapter, ``Selection and Chronic Disease Research: The Seatbelt--Diabetes Link,'' is a tongue-in-cheek cautionary tale about statistical technique conceived while I was studying the epidemiological literature for a course in health economics. While many epidemiologists are now adapting current econometric techniques to the study of disease, I found too many studies in high-profile journals ignoring the behavioral aspects of chronic disease -- leading to the use of data or statistical techniques inadequate to control for the problems of self-selection that social scientists all too often face. Using a repeated cross-section of data on health behaviors and mimicking multivariate models found in the epidemiology literature, I demonstrate a spurious 'causal link' between seatbelt non-use and several chronic diseases. I further show that varying degrees of self-reported seatbelt non-use are able to generate a dose-response gradient in the risk for those diseases, a type of relationship often taken as evidence in support of a causal link. Finally I use variation in the dates of passage of different states' seatbelt laws to demonstrate that the connection between seatbelt non-use and risk of a diabetes diagnosis became stronger after the passage of laws mandating seatbelt use. This presents an additional problem even for experienced statisticians -- unknown events may alter the patterns of self-selection, interfering with the course of an existing studied treatment. Lest the point be missed, I take ample care to document that seatbelt non-users are less healthy than seatbelt users in every dimension, from the amount of fruit and vegetables they eat to their likelihood of seeing a doctor for regular check-ups."			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:40Z (GMT).

Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleotides to C2 π-deoxyribonucleotides, the building blocks for both DNA synthesis and repair in all living organisms, via controlled radical chemistry. Since RNR expression is elevated in many cancers, this enzyme is a major target of anticancer drugs. Until recently, the only clinically proven RNR-inhibition pathway was a suicide inactivation in which synthetic substrate analogues, for instance, gemcitabine diphosphate (F2CDP), irreversibly inactivate the RNR-Œ±2Œ≤2 heterodimeric complex. Recently, Clofarabine (ClF) nucleotides have been shown to reversibly inhibit the enzyme by targeting the large subunit of RNR (RNR-Œ±) and inducing RNR- Œ±-persistent hexamerization. To date, ClF nucleotides are the only known examples of this mechanism. In order to establish whether this reversible inhibition is a common mode of inhibition among nucleotide-derivative drugs, the active forms of two other drugs, Cladribine (ClA) and Fludarabine (FlU), were chemoenzymatically synthesized and their mechanism(s) of inhibition of RNR were evaluated. Enzyme inhibition and fluorescence anisotropy assays show that di- and triphosphates of these two nucleosides reversibly inhibit RNR with diverse Ki values, fairly dispersed in a range of 0.5‚Äì10 ŒºM, and bind to the catalytic site (C-site) and the allosteric activity site (A- site) of RNR-Œ±, respectively. Our EM studies, gel filtration, FRET, and protease digestion assays suggest that RNR-inhibition is coupled with the formation of conformationally distinct hexamers. Studies in Flp-In HEK293 T-REx cells capable of selectively inducing either wild-type or oligomerization-defective mutant RNR-Œ± overexpression define the central role of RNR-Œ± oligomerization in drug activity, and highlight a potential resistant mechanism to these drugs. The results of these studies set the stage for new interventions targeting RNR oligomeric regulation."			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:42Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

By exploring the diversity and continuity of these relationships, this dissertation challenges the stark themes of socialist solidarity and capitalist hostility that frame much of the literature on communist China‚Äôs international experience under Mao. Instead, what emerges is an adaptive mode of CCP engagement with capitalism that transcended the Cold War ideological divide. Understanding the larger historical significance of this engagement requires thinking about these commercial transactions as more than the transfer of goods, services, and currencies. Business deals also served as sites for the exchange of ideas, habits, and beliefs, and as venues where individuals, institutions, and the logics that guided them underwent subtle but lasting transformations. These latent influences lie at the heart of this dissertation, which is as much a political, diplomatic, social, and cultural history of communist China in the world during the mid-twentieth century as it is an international history of Chinese communist business and trade.
These findings contribute to several veins of historical scholarship. They advance debate over the significance of ideology to Cold War international relations by tracing how CCP foreign-policy ideas transformed through sustained contact with foreign capitalists. The project brings Mao's China into the field of transnational history by moving beyond high politics to explore working-level ties between the CCP and foreign firms, smuggling rings, and other nongovernmental organizations. Finally, this dissertation reorients the study of capitalism in China by challenging the longstanding presumption that ""liberation"" in 1949 marked China‚Äôs withdrawal from global capitalism. As the dissertation shows, China‚Äôs ties to capitalism transformed under Mao, but never broke off entirely. 
The dissertation draws from a variety of sources not typically associated with scholarship on Mao‚Äôs China. In addition to fresh documents produced by Chinese officials at the central, provincial, and municipal levels, the project also draws from advertisements, corporate statements, ship manifests, and other materials from commercial and state archives in China, Hong Kong, the United States, Japan, and Great Britain."			5/1/22		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:38Z (GMT).

Silyl protected acetylenes are readily reacted to yield the corresponding 2-naphthylsilane. These compounds serve as synthetically useful building blocks for further derivatization and iterative benzannulation to access sterically crowded substrates (Chapter 2). Despite the high efficiency of this reaction, phenylene ethynylene macrocycles prove to be too rigid to undergo complete benzannulation (Chapter 3). Finally, the scope of this transformation was expanded beyond aryl substituted acetylenes with the benzannulation of silyl-haloacetylenes (Chapter 4). These products readily generate 2-naphthynes with the addition of cesium fluoride and can be oligomerized or cyclized to isolate substituted ortho-naphthalenes. Through our fundamental studies into this transformation, we have shown it serves as a versatile reaction in the organic synthetic chemists toolbox to access novel aromatic architectures.

MRI can be used to detect field inhomogeneity induced by blood iron molecules such as deoxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and hemosiderin, providing opportunities to identify and quantify these molecules and oxygen consumption, especially in brain. This dissertation reports: 1) a clinical study on intracranial hematoma evolution using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM); 2) a new magnetic susceptibility based signal model and MRI technique to quantitatively map cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) using QSM; 3) a new algorithm to improve SNR of QSM-based CMRO2 using prior knowledge; 4) a new algorithm called minimal local variance (MLV) to improve clinical practicality of QSM-based CMRO2 by removing the requirement of blood flow challenge. The potential impacts, limitations and future directions of each studies are also discussed.					"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:35Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

I deconstruct the predominant interpretative model (the locus sanctus model), which relies on iconographic and localized notions of ‚Äúsacred mimesis‚Äù and ‚Äúcontagion‚Äù to determine the circumstances of production, distribution, and social meaning of Asia Minor ampullae. Formal, visual, and contextual analysis of published objects and catalogued ampullae from Sardis, which focuses on materiality and reception, disassociate the Asia Minor corpus from that of Menas. By introducing the concept of ‚Äúinfinite divinity,‚Äù I free the Asia Minor ampullae from the absolute locative conditions of the locus sanctus model and provide an alternate understanding of their connection to sacred travel and devotion in late antiquity.			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:43Z (GMT).

Yet research into the inclusionary production of environmental knowledge (‚ÄúI.P.E.K.‚Äù) tends to treat all knowledge-making endeavors as scientifically motivated, when in fact other epistemic aims govern the production of environmental knowledge for regulation or management. This study parses out the inclusionary production of environmental knowledge for management as a phenomenon worthy of study without recourse to the epistemic aims of science. Drawing on three cases of locally based and small-scale urban environmental management practices (often referred to as ‚Äústewardship‚Äù or ‚Äúcivic ecology‚Äù), this exploratory qualitative study sheds new light on two forms of inclusionary knowledge production within these practices. The first form resembles adaptive co-management initiatives that rely on the collection of surveillance or monitoring data to inform adaptations in practice. This study finds a three-part division of labor in making data collection a part of practice, comprised of: Tool Patrons, who sponsor the creation of new data collection tools, technologies, and protocols; Tool Makers, who construct data protocols and technologies outside of daily practice; and Tool Users‚Äîthe practitioners who must weave data collection initiatives into their work together. This division of labor creates both opportunities and challenges for incorporating data collection into practice as a means of making useful environmental knowledge for management. The second form reframes civic ecology and stewardship practices as contemporary urban analogues to traditional subsistence societies and looks at knowledge produced tacitly within these practices in similar terms. A preliminary exploration of tacit knowledge making and management within civic ecology and stewardship practices suggests that practitioners do construct knowledge together as a feature of practice and encode their insights in story. While practitioners reach to find knowledge from sources outside of practice, not all new insights are readily incorporated into practice. Finally, the tendency to rely on transient forms of volunteer or seasonal staff labor in stewardship and civic ecology practices may create challenges for both managing the knowledge created in practice and retaining volunteers.

Ion trapping has often been observed in circular accelerators, but has never before been seen in single-pass linear accelerators.  However a new class of high intensity linacs will be the first such linear accelerators that experience ion trapping.  In the Cornell photoinjector, we have recently observed this phenomenon for the first time, and we will share our experiences conducting experiments to study ion trapping, as well as theory and simulations modeling the phenomenon.
We start by outlining theories to determine whether or not ion trapping will occur in an accelerator.  We describe in detail some of the effects that ions can have on a beam, including emittance growth, optical errors, beam losses and even beam instabilities.  The severity of these effects varies widely depending on the accelerator in question, so we offer up several simulation techniques that can be used to predict their occurrence, as well as ion signatures that can be observed experimentally to confirm the presence of ions.  We share results from experiments that tested three major ion clearing methods: ion clearing electrodes, bunch gaps, and beam shaking.  Results obtained from these experiments are supported by various theories and simulation codes.  Finally, because taking beam property measurements in the regime where ion trapping occurs can be difficult, we offer up a new design for a rotating wire scanner capable of obtaining beam profiles at high beam intensity."

In the United States this function is carried out by the National Antimicrobial Monitoring System.  This effort combines the United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety Inspection Service collecting samples from slaughter facilities, the Food and Drug Administration collection samples from retail and the Center for Disease Control collecting samples from human medicine. In order to better understand single and multi-drug resistance as well as how their monitoring could be improved a comprehensive analysis of this surveillance data was undertaken.  
After an introductory chapter, the second chapter presents an analysis of single drug resistance measured both in terms of the amount of antibiotic required to prevent bacterial growth, minimum inhibitory concentration, and the proportion of isolates exceeding a given resistance cutoff.  The effects of measuring resistance in these two different ways are compared along with the consequences of resistance cutoff choices.  An analysis of variability is then carried out and used in an assessment of power and sample sizes.  The examination of trends in single drug resistance reveals that these trends depend very much on the host, bacteria, and antimicrobial context regardless of whether one considers minimum inhibitory concentration or resistance proportion and that the resistance cutoff chosen has a dramatic impact on the nature of the trend observed.  Measurements of single drug resistance are overdispersed which means large sample sizes are required to detect changes in resistance.  
The third chapter focuses on identifying multi-drug resistance associations by constructing contingency tables of resistance counts and modeling then with log-linear models.   This approach uncovers associations that are in some cases so extreme they cannot be tested for using asymptotic or exact conditional methods and instead require a Bayesian approach.  Interrogation into the nature of these interactions reveals a spectrum of interactions including a hierarchy among the -lactams.  
The fourth chapter explores the variability of interactions discovered in chapter three.   As was the case with single drug resistance, multi-drug resistance also displays more variability than expected.  This increased variability or overdispersion is likely due to unaccounted factors like antimicrobial use, husbandry practices and food handling hygiene procedures."			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:41Z (GMT).

The use of a low repetition rate laser system (100 fs at 790 nm and 1 kHz repetition rate) can enable the future transfer of this technique to in vivo applications. However, it is essential to understand the biophysical parameter space of this technique beforehand. We examined the optoporation dependence on the extracellular calcium concentration in HeLa cells. We observed a low cell recovery rate in calcium free medium and varying cell viabilities with different calcium concentrations, possibly related to calcium dependent repair processes. Also we followed the calcium rise in the cell by a   fluorescent calcium indicator. We extended our previous model of pore formation model and applied different sized dextrans to verify our assumptions on pore radius, and resealing time. Therefore, this study provides a better understanding of the biophysical processes accompanying single cell laser transfection.
Drug delivery into the brain is inhibited by the blood brain barrier and limited by the structure of the brain interstitium. Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is a technique that delivers therapeutics by infusing directly into brain parenchyma through a needle inserted into the brain. We developed a fast scanning, real time volumetric imaging platform to image transport of nanoparticles in the rat cortex in vivo with high temporal and spatial resolution and to study transport mechanisms for different sized nanoparticles in the brain interstitium and the perivascular space (PVS). Fluorescent polystyrene beads of sizes ranging from 20nm to 200nm were infused directly into a rat cortex. Particles sized >100nm had distribution routes along the perivascular spaces and were relatively hindered in the extracellular spaces in comparison to particles in the 20nm ‚Äì 40nm size range that prefered transport in extracellular space.  Thus, we can study the alterations in the shape, size and movement of the infusion in the brain, allowing for better control for potential clinical design and optimization."			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:43Z (GMT).

The first phase of this research utilizes Stephen Marshall‚Äôs techniques to quantify the Altstadt‚Äôs urban form, and implements additional architectural analysis to uncover the original street network. These techniques reveal that the ancient city utilized traditional grid forms but was forced to accommodate for irregular terrain. Oriented regardless of topography, its layout has a similar rotation to Vitruvius‚Äôs ideal city even though it predated De Architectura by five centuries. This specific orientation connects Pompeii‚Äôs urban development to that of other archaic cities around the Mediterranean. Because Pompeii‚Äôs culture is best defined as a triangulation of Greek, Etruscan, and Oscan, this research complicates previous assumptions that Vitruvius‚Äô intellectual precursor was wholly Greek and questions the scholarly tendency of attributing strict cultural boundaries to various ancient practices.

This dissertation lies at the intersection of these three fields, and the underlying theme is the empirical investigation that enhances our understanding of the mechanisms that drive economic
activities that we observe today.
The first chapter examines how labor market composition and macroeconomic conditions affect each other. A dual labor market structure that consists of ‚Äúpermanent jobs‚Äù and ‚Äútemporary jobs‚Äù is common in many Continental European countries and in Japan, and over the last two decades, the share of temporary workers in these countries has increased markedly. In this chapter, I
demonstrate through an analysis of Japanese household panel survey data that permanent workers experience faster wage growth than temporary workers. Then, building a search and matching model of dual labor market with endogenous human capital accumulation, I show that, in the presence of two different types of jobs with different rates of return to experience, a slowing of the economic growth rate in a dual labor market structure can prompt a substantial shift in the composition of jobs.
The second chapter proposes a nonparametric method for studying the time series properties of macroeconomic variables. In particular, I focus on a class of learning networks called the Radial Basis Function (RBF). The main advantage of the RBF method is its flexibility and that it requires minimal functional-form assumptions. To assess the potential value of the RBF method, I simulate data points using a nonlinear New-Keynesian (NK) DSGE model and show that the RBF time series can uncover the nonlinear NK structure from simulated data observations whose length is as small as 300 (quarters). I then compare the out-of-sample prediction performance of the resulting network formula with other traditional time series methods, i.e., Vector-Autoregression and Bayesian VAR models. Finally, I apply this RBF time series method to US macroeconomic data from 1960-2010.
The third chapter studies the link between the probability of default implied by Credit Default Swaps (CDS) spreads and the final prices of the defaulted bonds as established at the CDS settlement auctions. We observe that the postdefault recovery rates at the observed spreads imply markets were often ‚Äòsurprised‚Äù by the credit event. We find that the prices of the bonds that are deliverable
at the auctions imply probabilities of default that are systematically different than the default probabilities estimated prior to the event of default using standard methodologies. We discuss the implications for CDS pricing models. We analyze the discrepancy etween the actual and theoretical CDS spreads and we find it is significantly associated both to the CDS market microstructure at the time of the settlement auction and to the general macroeconomic background. We discuss the potential for strategic bidding behavior at the CDS settlement auctions."			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:44Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

It analyzes Project C.O.R.E. and the effect it will have on the neighborhood of Sandtown-Winchester. This thesis argues that rightsizing policies have and will continue to have a negative impact on low-income, predominately African-American neighborhoods in the city by destroying the cultural and built environment and their historic resources. It asserts that rightsizing is a short-sighted public policy. 
The work argues this claim by first providing a history of the city of Baltimore emphasizing how racialized policies shaped the built environment. It analyzes the urban policies of the late 20th century that were designed to revitalize Sandtown-Winchester. This thesis reviews of rightsizing as urban policy, and ends with recommendations for how the city can manage vacant properties in a more equitable and fair way. The recommendations suggest rightsizing policies be reformed in order to reconsider the effect that they have on disinvested minority populations."

after class of materials due to their novel physical properties, distinct from both the
individual nanoparticle and the bulk material from which they are composed. Several
successful methods have been established to produce these exotic materials. One method in particular, DNA-mediated assembly, has enabled a stunning variety of lattice
structures to be constructed. By covalently conjugating DNA molecules to nanoparticle
surfaces, this method uses the sequence binding specificity of DNA to mediate the large-scale assembly of nanoparticles. This method however, relies on complex sequence
design, and is optimized to a very specific set of solution parameters, such as pH, ionic
strength, and temperature.
Here, we sought to expand the parameter base in which DNA capped gold
nanoparticles can form superlattices in solution. This was achieved by treating DNA as a
generic polymer, namely by eliminating the complex base-pairing interactions, greatly
simplifying the assembly process. In particular we aimed to understand the solution phase
parameters governing the assembly dynamics of DNA-capped gold nanoparticles. The
adsorption dynamics of individual DNA-capped gold nanoparticles on a positively
charged substrate was first characterized in various electrolyte solutions, establishing a
kinetic model of adsorption. These same parameters were then used to facilitate the self-assembly of three-dimensional DNA-capped gold nanoparticles in solution. Finally,
progress towards the application of solution phase two-dimensional nanoparticle
superlattices was undertaken. We envision that this work characterizing and elucidating
the solution phase dynamics of DNA-capped gold nanoparticles will serve to ultimately
facilitate their application in functional materials."			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:43Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

OCM are associated with aberrant DNA synthesis and methylation and high risk for cancer. Thus, it is of particular importance to elucidate the role of these nutrients in the functioning of OCM. In addition, the status of these nutrients and their demand differ by reproductive and/or
pathological state, further addressing the need to better understand the effects of these nutrients. This dissertation research involves both human participant studies and laboratory-based molecular research to advance current knowledge of the role of these nutrients.
Study 1 examined the impact of mandatory folic acid fortification on DNA methylation status among postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women‚Äôs Health Initiative Observational Study (WHI-OS). As expected, given the role of folate in OCM, women with higher red blood
cell (RBC) folate concentration had higher DNA methylation in the pre-fortification period. However, this expected result was not observed in the post-fortification period during which women with higher (vs. lower) RBC folate status had lower DNA methylation. Overall, these
findings suggest an inverted U-shaped relationship between folate status and DNA methylation across fortification periods, and further investigation is warranted to clarify the health outcomes of the inverse relationship observed in the era of folic acid fortification.
Study 2 examined associations between biomarkers of choline metabolism and colorectal cancer risk in a case-control study nested within the WHI-OS. The main findings indicate 1) a positive association between plasma trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO; a derivative of choline
produced by intestinal bacteria) and rectal cancer risk; and 2) an inverse relationship between plasma betaine and colorectal cancer risk. These findings demonstrate that alterations in choline metabolism associate with higher risk of colorectal cancer, suggesting the potential utilization of these biomarkers as predictors of increased colorectal cancer risk.
Study 3 assessed changes in status and functional biomarkers of vitamin B12 among pregnant, lactating and control (nonpregnant, nonlactating) women who consumed equivalent vitamin B12 intakes under controlled feeding conditions. Pregnant (vs. control) women had a higher ratio of plasma holotranscobalamin (bioactive form of vitamin B12) to total vitamin B12, indicating that greater amounts of vitamin B12 are partitioned toward the biologically active form in this reproductive state. Overall, the results of this study suggest that metabolic
adaptations transpire to enhance vitamin B12 supply during pregnancy.
Study 4 employed in vitro cell culture models to investigate the effect of folate-independent generation of formate, a primary source of one-carbons for folate-mediated OCM, on the synthesis of purines and thymidylate. The study findings demonstrate that in human
hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cells, alcohol dehydrogenase 5 is a source of formate for de novo purine biosynthesis, especially during folate deficiency when folate-dependent formate production is limited.
Taken together, this dissertation research spans from in vitro molecular studies to epidemiological studies to address the role of folate, choline and vitamin B12. The findings of this research will help inform the development of nutrient intake recommendations and the use of
nutritional biomarkers for disease prediction."					"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:44Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

A precise assessment of the number of Southeast Asians fighting in Iraq and Syria is hard to make, but according to the Soufan Group‚Äôs December 2015 report ‚ÄúForeign Fighters,‚Äù Indonesia has sent roughly 500 fighters to the Middle East, while Malaysia, with 1/10th as many Muslims, has sent around 100. That is roughly 2.5 Indonesian fighters per million and 5 Malaysian fighters per million (twice as many proportionally). The three plausible explanations addressed in this thesis are: (1) externalities of a strong state, (2) the influence of Arabization and (3) the availability of financial and language resources. The paper is focused on making judgments on patterns of behavior that the reader may find useful when looking at the issue of terrorism in Southeast Asia, as these explanations are meant to provide a foundation for understanding factors that likely influence Islamist violence in the aggregate.

Throughout human history, migration has been
vital to our survival, and continues to be central to our political discussions and
economic fortunes. This dissertation contributes to an understanding of the effects
of migration on welfare and taxation.
In chapter 1, I examine the welfare effects of immigration on United States
workers. I build a dynamic search and matching model in which immigrants and
natives differ according to their outside options, separation rates, wealth holdings
and skill composition. Immigration affects native-born welfare by i) altering the
skill composition of the labor force, ii) lowering the expected hiring cost of firms,
and iii) altering the rate of return on wealth. I demonstrate that the transition
period, during which the economy adjusts to immigration, involves both higher
returns to wealth and inferior labor market conditions in comparison to the long
run steady state. Accounting for transition dynamics therefore shifts the welfare
effects of immigration in favor of wealthy households at the expense of workers.
In chapter 2, I shift the discussion from the movement of labor across national
boundaries to the internal movement of labor from rural to urban locations. I analyze
the welfare effects of a policy of modern sector enlargement (MSENL), and
a policy of increasing the efficiency of on-the-job search from the urban informal
sector (IEOS) in a generalized Harris-Todaro model. I show that MSENL causes a Lorenz worsening of the income distribution and IEOS causes a Lorenz improvement.
In a rare direct application of the Atkinson theorem, I conclude that MSENL
decreases social welfare and IEOS increases social welfare for all anonymous, increasing
and Schur-concave social welfare functions.
In chapter 3, I return to international migration by investigating its effect on
the ability of governments to raise tax revenue. I construct Laffer curves using
a static two country neoclassical model with international labor mobility. I show
that international migration i) shifts the peak of the Laffer curve to the left, and ii)
is quantitatively more important than the labor supply elasticity in determining
the shape and position of the Laffer curve. Asimple calibration reveals that almost
every country in the EU-14 is currently located on the ‚Äúslippery slope‚Äù portion of
both the labor tax and capital tax Laffer curves.In chapter 4, I depart from the theme of migration while retaining the focus on
the tax system. Kyle Rozema and I analyze the effect of tax expenditures on the stabilizing power of the tax system. We propose a microsimulation strategy which exploits links that we identify between automatic stabilizers, tax expenditures,
and effective marginal tax rates. Using the Survey of Consumer Finances from
1988 to 2009, we estimate that, on average, the Mortgage Interest Deduction and the Charitable Contributions Deduction increased the sensitivity of consumption to income fluctuations from a baseline of 0.14 by 1.13% and 0.97%, respectively."			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:44Z (GMT).

It focuses on the epistemological theory of intrinsic validity (svata·∏• prƒÅmƒÅ·πáya) of cognition presented by the 7th century South Asian philosopher KumƒÅrila Bha·π≠·π≠a and presents an intellectual historical account of some developments in the history of pre-modern South Asian epistemology. It attempts to present a historical account of this theory in relation to its own intellectual milieu‚Äîi.e. in relation to the tradition to which KumƒÅrila belonged‚Äîas well as in relation to its opponents‚Äîi.e. to the 10th century Kashmirian philosopher Jayanta Bha·π≠·π≠a. Additionally, this paper is committed to the presupposition that innovation does not occur in a vacuum and that only by paying close attention to texts and textual traditions can we gain a more nuanced understanding of the developments in pre-modern South Asian thought and philosophical traditions in particular.

Downy mildew is a disease that causes rapid plant death in cucumbers. A new strain of Pseudoperonospora cubensis, the causal oomycete agent of the disease, had overcome the resistance of all available commercial cultivars. Through a phenotypic selection-based breeding program, we developed new slicing cucumbers with high resistance to the disease, including ‚ÄòDMR-NY264‚Äô and the earlier-maturing ‚ÄòDMR-NY401‚Äô. These lines outperformed commercial standard cultivars under disease pressure, and produced until the end of the season in the northeastern U.S. without fungicide application. 2. Powdery mildew, caused by the fungal pathogens Podosphaera xanthii and Golovinomyces cichoracearum, is the most prevalent disease worldwide on squash, and if unmanaged, can lead to decreased yield, fruit quality, and plant death. Although robust natural resistance is unknown in cultivated species, a gene from the wild species Cucurbita okeechobeensis subsp. martinezii was previously introgressed into all resistant commercial cultivars. To date, no markers have been published for this important gene. We used cultivar-based introgression mapping with SNP markers to map the Pm-0 locus to a 76.4 kb genomic interval, and this interval was validated with other mapping approaches. Several markers and candidate genes for Pm-0 are reported. 3. To date, genomic resources for pea improvement have been lacking. We assembled the USDA Pea Single Plant Plus Collection (PSPPC), a diverse core collection of peas to assist efforts towards trait mapping and genomics-assisted breeding. We used genotyping-by-sequencing to generate 66,591 SNPs that are publicly available. With this dataset, we identified sources of genetic diversity for breeding programs, demonstrated its utility for trait mapping by pinpointing the previously-cloned ‚ÄúA‚Äù locus controlling flower color, and constructed a smaller core collection which preserved the genetic diversity and minor alleles of the original collection.

human nutrition in Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. However, its poor flower set and lack
of flowering synchrony makes it hard to breed improved genotypes with higher production and
superior qualities. Previous findings indicated that applying silver thiosulfate (STS) could improve
cassava flower retention and might be useful in cassava breeding. However, at the rates used it might
induce severe phytotoxicity on the plants, and there is concern silver may accumulate in the soil. The
goal of this research was to find better strategies to apply STS and reduce plant phytotoxicity.
Experiments with ethephon showed that ethylene was responsible for cassava flower abortion and
senescence. STS inhibited ethylene signaling thus protecting the flowers from abortion and
senescence. Compared to wide-scale spraying of STS to mature leaves, localized STS application to
the apex was equally effective for flower retention, and it requires less silver. To develop an optimal
protocol, tests were conducted to find 1) the best timing for STS applications; 2) the number of
applications required for better flowering; 3) the best placement for STS application; and 4) the best
concentration for STS application on cassava. Overall, the findings indicate that optimal STS
treatment is when it starts at least several days before bud appearance, and with a continued supply
during flowering. STS application to the young leaves in the apex avoids excess application and
phytotoxicity. STS dosage requires optimization: it needs to be sufficiently high for substantial
flowering benefit, and low enough to avoid phytotoxicity. These findings indicate that STS could
serve as a potentially valuable tool for cassava breeders in managing flowering"					"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:45Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

These popular, coldwater sport fish face an uncertain fate in light of several climate change scenarios. Assessing the potential influence of variable temperature on brook trout populations poses an important challenge to fisheries biologists. I conducted a robust design mark-recapture study in three lakes in New York's Adirondack Park to estimate population parameters related to survival, abundance, detection probability and movement under contrasting thermal conditions. Results from candidate model set comparisons support the hypotheses that brook trout living in unstratified lakes experienced reduced survivorship in hot, dry years, while fish living in nearby, stratified lakes did not. Furthermore, chronic thermal stress metrics, when added as covariates, received significantly more support in the model set than acute metrics, (i.e., maximum water temperature), highlighting the relative importance of cumulative thermal stress on adult survival.

Despite Latin America‚Äôs deep gender inequalities, women have democratically won the presidency more times here than in any other region in the world. Presidentas could have a major impact on these inequalities because Latin American presidents enjoy vast formal powers. Though similarly situated, Presidents Michelle Bachelet in Chile and Dilma Rousseff in Brazil dramatically diverged in their use of these prerogatives to advance pro-women change.
	This dissertation solves the Bachelet-Rousseff puzzle with a novel, constituency-centered theory. I argue that female politicians are most likely to deploy their power to promote change favoring women when they have (1) successfully mobilized women on the basis of gender identity (core constituency); and (2) extensively networked with elite feminists and other female politicians (personal constituency). The theory explains why female politicians overall are more likely than their male counterparts to use their power to advance pro-women change, articulates the conditions under which female politicians will make a difference and predicts the kinds of pro-women policies they are most likely to pursue. It therefore provides fresh insights on the benefits and limitations of women‚Äôs presence in political office. 
	To illustrate and test this constituency theory, I employ newspaper archives to trace the formation of constituencies of all viable candidates in Chile‚Äôs and Brazil‚Äôs presidential races from 1999-2010. I then measure the use of legislative and delegative power to advance pro-women change by the winners of these elections with three original databases. Challenging existing theories of representation, the results of the qualitative and statistical analyses support my argument that gendered and sex-related characteristics of presidents‚Äô core and personal constituencies largely determine the extent to which and how they use of power to promote pro-women change."

In chapter 1, ``Hours Off the Clock,'' I address a simple but confounding research question: To what extent do workers work more hours than they are paid for? The relationship between hours worked and hours paid, and the conditions under which employers can demand more hours  ``off the clock,"" is not well understood. The answer to this question affects worker welfare, as well as wage and hour regulation. In addition, work off the clock has important implications for the measurement and cyclical movement of productivity and wages. In this chapter, I construct a unique administrative dataset of hours paid by employers linked to a survey of workers on their reported hours worked to measure work off the clock. Using cross-sectional variation in local labor markets, I find only a small cyclical component to work off the clock. The results point to labor hoarding rather than efficiency wage theory, indicating work off the clock cannot explain the counter-cyclical movement of productivity. I find workers employed by small firms, and in industries with a high rate of wage and hour violations are associated with larger differences in hours worked than hours paid. These findings suggest the importance of tracking hours of work for enforcement of labor regulations.
In chapter 2, ``Hours Adjustments: Evidence from Linked Employer-Employee Data,'' coauthored with fellow graduate student Nellie Zhao, we provide the first look at administrative data on hours worked within firms. We document the extent to which part-time work varies across industries, and confirm that part-time work is concentrated in relatively low-wage service sectors. Further, we take advantage of the longitudinal nature of our dataset and analyze the prevalence of transitions between part-time and full-time work within the same job. We show that the share of new full-time or part-time jobs that are created due to within-job hours changes varies greatly across industries.
In chapter 3, ``Total Error and Variability Measures with Integrated Disclosure Limitation for Quarterly Workforce Indicators and LEHD Origin Destination Employment Statistics in OnTheMap,'' coauthored with Kevin L. McKinney, Lars Vilhuber, and John M. Abowd, we report results from the first comprehensive total quality evaluation of five major indicators in the U.S. Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Program Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI). We conducted the evaluation by generating multiple threads of the edit and imputation models used in the LEHD Infrastructure File System. These threads conform to the Rubin (1987) multiple imputation model, with each thread or implicate being the output of formal probability models that address coverage, edit, and imputation errors. Design-based sampling variability and finite population corrections are also included in the evaluation. We derive special formulas for the Rubin total variability and its components that are consistent with the disclosure avoidance system used for QWI. These formulas allow us to publish the complete set of detailed total quality measures for QWI and LODES. The analysis reveals that the five publication variables are estimated very accurately for tabulations involving at least 10 jobs. Tabulations involving three to nine jobs have acceptable quality. Tabulations involving zero, one or two jobs have substantial total variability."					"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:45Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

To further our understanding of how high-traffic roadways contribute to urban UFP concentrations, a mobile sampling strategy is developed to measure UFP on a perpendicular transect near interstate 81 (I-81) in Syracuse, New York. Measurements are taken during morning rush hour and non rush hour using a bicycle-mounted TSI Nanoscan scanning mobility particle sizer capable of measuring particles with diameters of 10 ‚Äì 420 nm. UFP concentrations near I-81 are considerably lower and more variable than reported in previous studies. The spatial decay of UFP with distance from I-81 is examined, and a linear mixed-effects model is generated to determine the variables that influence near I-81 UFP concentrations. Temperature, sampling time, and distance are important predictors of near-I-81 UFP concentrations, but local UFP sources are evident and identification of such sources is explored					"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:46Z (GMT).

It is unclear, however, whether children recognize that rules can be changed in certain contexts and by certain people or groups. Across three studies, we provided empirical evidence that children consider individual authority and collective agreement when reasoning about who can change rules. In Study 1, children of 4 to 7 years old watched videos of children playing simply sorting and stacking games in groups or alone. Across conditions the group game was initiated 1) by one child, 2) by collaborative agreement, or 3) by an adult authority. In the group games with a rule initiated by one child, children attributed ability to change rules only to that individual and not his/her friends, and mentioned ownership and authority in their explanations. When the rule was initiated collaboratively, older children said that no individual could change the rule, while young children said that either individual could do so. When an adult initiated the rule children stated that only the adult could change it. In contrast, children always endorsed a child‚Äôs decision to change his own solitary play, and never endorsed any child‚Äôs ability to change moral and conventional rules in daily life. Age differences corresponded to beliefs about friendship and agreement in peer play (Study 2) and disappeared when the decision process behind and normative force of collaboratively initiated rules was clarified (Study 3). These results show important connections between normativity and considerations of authority and collaboration in early childhood.					"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:46Z (GMT).

Corinna Maxine Carol Matlis
Cornell University 2017
This dissertation examines the interplay between early-eleventh-century Norman literature and the Norman ducal family‚Äôs project of establishing its legitimacy to rule.  The dissertation considers Dudo of Saint Quentin‚Äôs arcane history of the Norman dukes, Warner of Rouen‚Äôs two esoteric satires, and two further anonymous satires produced in Rouen c. 996-1026 (the reign of Duke Richard II).  These works constitute the secular Norman literature during this period.  Although the texts‚Äô audiences are unknown, it is clear that the ducal family, local clerics, and potentially nobility throughout the region and France were among the works‚Äô addressees.  Despite their obscurity to modern readers, these texts spoke to the interests of the highest echelons of Norman society.  Throughout my dissertation, I show how these texts were understood in their own time and how they spoke to contemporary social and political issues.  Common themes emerge throughout the texts, despite their different genres:  most importantly, the ducal family‚Äôs strategic marriages, and the desire for the appearance of a cultured court in order to balance the Normans‚Äô reputation of physical might.  Reading these Rouennais texts together offers new views of Norman political culture that have not been available without a close look at this literature as a whole.  
The literature should also be considered in the context of contemporary monastic and ecclesiastical reforms.  The growing interest in ecclesiastical celibacy and other reforms influenced these texts, especially where they portray religious debates or satirical bawdiness, but the reforms‚Äô influence in curtailing the production of secular texts in the late 1020s should not be overstated.  Instead, it was political concerns that dictated the writing of the Rouennais literature and also dictated the end of its production.  
This dissertation‚Äôs methodology is to discuss the convergences and divergences in style, theme, and content of the texts in order to discuss the context in which the pieces were written.  I combine this approach at times with evidence from diplomatic sources.  This dissertation offers more evidence for a recent trend in Norman scholarship that sees the early-eleventh-century as a time of political consolidation for the Norman ducal family."			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:46Z (GMT).

Yet, many of the services upon with agriculture relies, such as biological pest control and pollination, are provided by diverse communities of beneficial insects. Several studies have documented declines in the diversity and abundance of pollinators and natural enemies in landscapes with high agricultural cover. However, we lack a framework for predicting which species are most threatened by agricultural intensification and which are likely to persist. Additionally, studies documenting negative effects on ecosystem services and crop yield have been rare. Therefore the ecological but also the economic impact of land use intensification remains unclear. Here, I investigate the effects of landscape simplification due to agricultural intensification on both pollinator and natural enemy communities providing services to fruit farms in New York State. In each study, I evaluate effects on community composition, ecosystem service delivery and ultimately crop yield. My results reveal that landscape simplification is associated with a loss in abundance, species richness and functional diversity from beneficial insect communities. Loss of species from communities was not random but rather mediated by traits that are often similar among closely related species. As a result the evolutionary history represented within communities in highly agricultural landscapes was 200 million years less than communities in more diverse landscapes. For bees, functional and phylogenetic diversity better predicted pollination services and crop yield compared to species richness alone. Overall, both pollination services and biological control were negatively influenced by agricultural intensification. However, I also explore one landscape and one local scale strategy to recover community diversity and ecosystem services. At the landscape scale, a diversity of crops emphasizing complementarity in bloom time can promote spillover of pollinators from mass flowering crops like apple into consecutively blooming crops such as strawberry. At the local scale, wildflower plantings bordering crops can support diverse pollinator communities but were most effective when implemented in landscapes with intermediate cover of natural habitats. Importantly, pest populations were higher in plantings with an adjacent wildflower border at sites with the least and most natural habitat cover.  Wildflower planting did little to enhance biological control of pests. These findings indicate that local habitat enhancements can have costs, but by targeting locations for establishment these costs can be minimized. By understanding the ecology agricultural ecosystems, we can conserve biodiversity while at the same time promoting crop productivity.					"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:36Z (GMT).

Higher intakes, particularly of fatty fish containing omega-3 fatty acids, are associated with improved brain and cardiovascular health. Most Americans do not consume the recommended amounts of fish and seafood. To explore fish and seafood food choice, a mixed methods project with two studies was designed and conducted in rural New York State with midlife adults (ages 50-75).
The first project was an in-depth qualitative study using interviews with midlife adults (n=31). Two aspects of these interviews were examined: 1) social representations of the health effects of fish and seafood and 2) the scripts used for fish and seafood provisioning. Core and peripheral social representations were identified and described. Individual patterns of involvement with social representations were presented. Scripts used for acquiring and preparing fish and seafood as well as eating out were characterized. The importance of script integration between linked script types was suggested.
Components of the qualitative findings and other factors were then examined
in a survey of midlife adults (n=212), including a sub-sample that also provided dried blood spots (n=100) for analysis of fatty acid levels. Individuals who agreed more strongly with positive social representations and who reported greater fish preparation confidence reported higher levels of fish intake and had higher omega-3 index levels. Future research should explore these phenomena in other populations using longitudinal and experimental designs."			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:46Z (GMT).

The approach frees users from having to hand-design such implementations and have utility for missions in which the system must maintain safety in dynamic, uncontrolled environments.  For instance, a personal assistant might be entrusted to fetch a box from a location and then deliver it to the required location in the household, while avoiding collisions with closed doors, people, and static obstacles.  In this work, three interrelated problems are solved, each addressing the overall problem of automatically synthesizing controllers with applicability to robots with complex, nonlinear dynamics.
First, an off-line approach is introduced for synthesizing low-level controllers for nonlinear systems.  The approach builds on sample-based motion planning and nonlinear system analysis techniques, and is capable of synthesizing a palette of controllers that certifies a task (mission instructions provided by a user via a formal specification).  To address cases where a task cannot be guaranteed on a given physical platform, the second contribution is an automated approach to specification revisions using information contained in a discrete representation (i.e. abstraction) of the dynamical system.  The user is provided with a concise yet expressive set of revisions as instructive feedback required to guarantee the specification.  The final contribution is a novel synthesis approach that extends the revisions approach to enable a team of robots operating in workspaces shared with other agents (e.g., humans or cars).  Whereas typical centralized controllers are combinatorially expensive to compute, our approach lessens this complexity while retaining correctness by leveraging a local motion planner and employing a high-level scheme that reasons about deadlock between two or more agents.  Throughout this work, the various approaches are demonstrated through a variety of missions carried out both in simulation and on physical platforms in dynamic environments."

This axis is regulated by interconnected hormonal feedback loops, permitting reproduction. Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) is secreted by the hypothalamus to act on the pituitary, resulting in gonadotropin secretion. The gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) are produced and secreted by pituitary gonadotropes, and act on the gonads, promoting steroidogenesis and gametogenesis. This dissertation focuses on two isoforms of ERK, ERK 1 and ERK 2. Although they do appear to have some redundant functions, ERK 1 is not able to compensate for loss of ERK 2. ERK1 null mice are viable and fertile, whereas loss of ERK2 is embryonic lethal. Therefore, ERK 2 has to be knocked out in a tissue or time dependent manner. For the studies included here, we utilize a mouse model of GnRHR associated ERK loss. This model allows us to investigate the role of ERK in pituitary gonadotropin production and secretion. ERK loss significantly reduced gonadotropin production, and this model allowed us to characterize the effects of hypogonadotropism as animals aged. We followed those studies with an investigation into GnRHR localization and function in the murine placenta, and the effects of ERK loss on placentation, gestation, and parturition. These experiments revealed abnormal histology and vascularization, prolonged gestation and dystocia, and absolute fetal mortality. Finally, we utilized unbiased screening techniques (RNA sequencing) to identify novel targets of GnRH signaling downstream of the ERK cascade. This revealed a bile acid receptor, TGR5, which has a functional role in gonadotropin production in the pituitary. Female TGR5 knockout are subfertile, with a marked delay in the onset of puberty. The studies in this dissertation describe the role of ERK in multiple aspects of the HPG axis. All of the studies have clinical implications, either in the understanding and treatment of idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) or in understanding links between puberty, nutrition, metabolism and fertility.			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:46Z (GMT).

A satisfactory account of political obligation must be able to show that there is a prima facie duty to do as the law commands because the law commands it.  Extant natural duty accounts are vulnerable to the charge that the best they can do is establish that there is a duty to comply with a special subset of laws, namely those laws general compliance with which is necessary for the state‚Äôs ability to administer justice or rescue people from the perils of the state of nature.  The view I develop overcomes this objection.  My strategy is to argue that justice intrinsically requires not only that we enter into political society, but further that we establish a particular kind of society ‚Äì one in which every person has an equal democratic say.  I argue that there is an important kind of servility that has been overlooked in the literature.  This servility consists in the willingness to subordinate one‚Äôs capacity for moral judgement to another‚Äôs.  I draw upon this account of servility in developing a new argument for the right to an equal democratic say.  Finally, I argue that laws which issue from a democratic process, a process that is itself intrinsically required by justice, have authority.			5/30/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:46Z (GMT).

Unfortunately, the quantum mechanical nature of these reactions, where nuclear motions mediate transitions between electronic states, makes them infeasible to simulate exactly in many-body systems because of the scaling limitations of exact quantum dynamics methods.  Developing approximate quantum dynamics methods capable of efficiently, yet accurately describing quantum processes in high-dimensional systems is, therefore, an ongoing effort in the field of theoretical chemistry and the focus of this dissertation.
The two methods we discuss here are based on the imaginary-time path integral formulation of the quantum Boltzmann distribution that allows quantum degrees of freedom to be represented by classical ``ring polymers"" in an extended phase space.  Specifically, these methods are versions of the promising ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) method for approximating quantum real-time thermal correlation functions using classical ring polymer trajectories.  The first method we discuss, mean field (MF)-RPMD, extends the original RPMD formulation to multi-electron systems and describes nuclear dynamics on an average potential energy surface. We show how a novel implementation of this method for rate calculations yields accurate electron transfer rate constants across a wide range of parameter regimes.
The second method we describe, mapping variable (MV)-RPMD, captures electronic state transitions using only classical MD trajectories by employing an exact mapping from discrete electronic states to classical phase-space variables.  In order to use this method to study photochemistry, we derive a function in the MV-RPMD framework that reports on electronic state populations as a function of time, and we introduce a constraint protocol to initialize an MV-RPMD simulation to a particular electronic state.  We numerically demonstrate the accuracy of this population function and constraint technique in the context of model systems undergoing electronic state transmission/reflection and photodissociation."

This thesis tested the hypothesis that the relationship between CS and EF may be a non-necessary one, especially in a homogeneous and highly bilingual population in Singapore where CS occurs pervasively. Accordingly, CS and EF measures were obtained from 43 English-Chinese 8-year-old children (27 females, M = 8.33 years). Spontaneous CS was measured with a novel task, and EF was measured in terms of verbal and non-verbal task-switching (e.g., Semantic Fluency, Hearts and Flowers) and verbal inhibitory control (e.g., Stroop task). Contrary to previous work with adults, children‚Äôs CS performance did not significantly predict general EF performance. On the other hand, some aspects of bilingual language proficiency did predict EF performance. Chinese school exam scores predicted Semantic Fluency switch cost (higher Chinese scores, higher switch cost), while English school exam scores predicted English Stroop Interference (higher English scores, lower Stroop Interference). In addition, correlational analyses also showed that broad bilingual language proficiency (measured in terms of school exam Oral and Written components) did correlate with EF performance. For Semantic Fluency, higher Oral Chinese scores were correlated with more items produced on the Pure Chinese block as well as lower switch cost. Higher Written and Oral English scores also correlated with more items produced on the Mixed Language blocks as well as lower switch cost. For Stroop, higher Written English and English EI scores correlated with lower English Stroop Interference. Thus, we conclude that the relationship between CS and EF may be non-necessary in this particular population. These results suggest that in a proficient bilingual population that frequently engages in CS, the relationship between CS and EF may be an indirect one, even in a developmental population where EF and bilingual language proficiency are still developing.			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:47Z (GMT).

Expansion of the public transportation system can potentially alleviate pollutions by diverting travelers from their vehicles. In this study, we conduct a spatial analysis to quantify the impact of subway expansion on air pollution in Beijing. The data we use consists daily monitor level Air Pollution Index (API) during 2008 to 2012, and spatial data of the geographic location of 27 monitors and 127 subway stations. We use the difference-in-difference approach for the analysis and divide the monitors into two groups based on their closest distances to the newly opened subway line. We find that after the subway opens, the API decreases significantly by 20.9% within a 30-Weekday window. The reduction effect on API maximizes at the first 10 weekdays after opening and fades out after 60 weekdays.					"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:47Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In particular, real-time price dynamically reflects the actual marginal cost of generating electricity and directly associates with market settlement. Methods of quantifying the effect of real-time pricing and optimal pricing policy design are needed to ensure reliable system operation and improve economic efficiency. In this thesis, three problems associated with real-time pricing in smart grid are studied. 
First, the impacts of data quality on real-time locational marginal price (LMP) is characterized. Because the real-time LMP is computed from the estimated network topology and system state, bad data that cause errors in topology processing and state estimation affect real-time LMP. It is shown that the power system state space is partitioned into price regions of convex polytopes. Under different bad data models, the worst case impacts of bad data on realtime LMP are analyzed. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate worst case performance for IEEE-14 and IEEE-118 networks.
Second, the problemof designing dynamic price of electricity in retailmarket is considered. For the day-ahead hourly pricing (DAHP) scheme, a Stackelberg game model is formulated with the retailer as a leader and its customers as followers. By solving a real-time load control problem, an affine structure between the optimal demand response and day-ahead retail price is established and the trade-off curve between consumer surplus (CS) and retail profit (RP) is characterized as a concave Pareto front, on which each point is an equilibrium of the Stackelberg game with a particular retailer‚Äôs payoff function. Effects of renewable energy and storage are also analyzed under the same Stackelberg game model. It is shown that the tradeoff curves with renewable energy or storage on the retailer side have significantly different characteristics from those ones on the consumer side. Simulations based on actual weather and price data are used to verify our statements.
Finally, the problem of optimal dynamic pricing for retail electricity with an unknown demand model is considered. Without knowledge on the aggregated demand function of its customers, a retailer aims to maximize its retail surplus by sequentially adjusting its price based on the behavior of its customers in the past. An online learning algorithm, referred to as piecewise linear stochastic approximation (PWLSA), is proposed. It is shown that PWLSA achieves the optimal rate of learning defined by the growth rate of cumulative regret. In particular, the regret of PWLSA is shown to grow logarithmically with respect to the learning horizon, and no other on-line learning algorithm can have the growth rate slower than that of PWLSA. Simulation studies are presented using traces of actual day-ahead prices, and PWLSA compares favorably under both static and dynamically changing parameters."

Due to the random nature of Mendelian inheritance, variance in the amount of the genome shared identically between two individuals of a certain degree of relatedness can be high, making relatedness inference difficult. While numerous methods exist for performing such inference, thorough evaluation of these methods in real data has been lacking. We assessed 11 state-of-the-art relatedness inference methods using a dataset with 2,485 individuals contained in several large pedigrees that span up to six generations. Overall, the methods have high accuracy (93%-99%) when reporting first and second degree relationships, but less than 60% accuracy for fifth degree relationships. We considered a composite method built off the three methods with highest accuracy in our analysis (ERSA 2.0, IBDseq, and Refined IBD) and applied it to the SAMAFS, HapMap3, and Weill Cornell Qatari datasets, finding numerous unreported relationships in all three datasets. Building on the insights from our analysis of methods, we developed DRUID---Deep Relatedness Utilizing Identity by Descent---a method that works by inferring the identical by descent (IBD) sharing profile of an ungenotyped ancestor of a set of close relatives. DRUID combines relatedness signals among multiple samples to effectively remove one or more generations of distance between a set of relatives, leading to substantial accuracy improvements compared to other methods.

In the research reported here, plant virus systems were used to explore the effects of coinfection on pathogen populations and host responses. Chapter 1 addresses the importance of coinfection timing using Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV-PAV) and Barley stripe mosaic virus.  Coinfection timing significantly influenced viral within-host competition.  Additionally, simultaneous coinfections were significantly more severe than sequential coinfections, which were only as severe as the most damaging constituent virus.  A mathematical model was used to demonstrate that inaccurate projections of disease impacts on host populations can result when the effects of coinfection timing are not taken onto account.  Chapter 2 explores the effects of coinfections of Cereal yellow dwarf virus (CYDV-RPV) and two species of BYDV (PAV and PAS) on pathogen evolution using an experimental evolution approach.  Viruses exhibited altered within-host concentrations and transmission after serial passage in coinfections, without altered disease severity.  Chapter 3 examines interactions between Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) and Clover yellow vein virus (ClYVV)), and a microbial mutualist, rhizobia bacteria.  The presence of rhizobia allowed ClYVV to reach higher within-host concentrations in coinfections.  Viral transmission was also affected by interactions between coinfection and plant nitrogen source.  Viral infection significantly reduced the percentage of nitrogen in plant tissues derived from microbial mutualists, with a greater than additive decrease in coinfections. Chapter 4 assesses the effects of BCMV and ClYVV coinfection and rhizobia colonization on plant primary and secondary metabolism.  Increased photosynthetic rates were observed in plants colonized by rhizobia, which were driven by increased maximum rates of electron transport.  Infection status, inorganic nitrogen fertilizer, and rhizobia had significant effects on components of plant volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, with nitrogen source significantly affecting overall VOC profile composition. Chapter 5 analyzes how reductions in rhizobial nitrogen fixation caused by viral infection affect soil fertility, and projects substantial monetary losses for farmers when viral prevalence is high in a legume rotation, either due to additional fertilizer costs or reduced yield of a subsequent non-legume crop.			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:47Z (GMT).

Temperature advancement between two wells separated by 14 m was monitored throughout the well field during progressive heating of the reservoir over 6 d. Multiple approaches to predicting heat transport were applied to field data and compared to temperature rise recorded during reservoir heat-up.
Tracer analysis incorporated both an analytical one-dimensional model and a two-dimensional numerical model for non-uniform fractures experiencing ‚Äúflow-channeling.‚Äù Modeling efforts demonstrated that estimating heat transfer surface area using a combined inert/adsorbing tracer (cesium-iodide) could provide accurate forecasting of premature thermal breakthrough. In addition, thermally degrading tracer tests were used to monitor inter-well temperature during progressive reservoir heating.
Inert tracers alone were, in general, inadequate in forecasting thermal performance. In fact, moment analysis shows that, mathematically, thermal breakthrough is independent of parameters that primarily influence inert
tracers. The most accurate prediction of thermal breakthrough using inert tracer alone was produced by treating hydrodynamic dispersion as a truly Fickian process with known and accurate mathematical models. Under this assumption, inert tracer data was matched by solving an inverse problem for non-uniform fracture aperture. Early arrival of the thermal front was predicted at the production, but was less accurate than using a combined inert/adsorbing tracer test.
The spatial distribution of fluid flow paths in the plane of the fracture were identified using computational models, Fiber-Optic Distributed Temperature Sensing (FO-DTS), and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) imaging of saline tracer flow paths in the target fracture. Without exception, fluid flow was found to be concentrated in a roughly 1 m wide flow channel directly between the two wells.
The following key findings summarize the results of this study: (1) flow channeling resulted in rapid thermal breakthrough; (2) advection-dispersion models for inert tracers cannot calibrate forward-models of thermal performance; (3) adsorption tracers accurately estimated heat transfer surface area; (4) thermally degrading tracer tests identified the migration of a thermal front; and (5) Principal Component Analysis can be used to simplify fracture aperture fields and subsequently aid in solving an inverse problem for non-uniform aperture. In addition, two significant fluid/rock interactions were found: (1) adsorption was rate-limited over the timespan of tracer tests at
Altona; and (2) the target fracture catalyzed thermal degradation leading to substantial over-estimates of inter-well temperature."					"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:47Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

These new techniques provide novel insights in (i) brain functions and (ii) the heterogeneity of virus particles.
Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) examines the low frequency spontaneous fluctuations in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals. It is widely used to investigate the brain activity at resting state, which is the state consuming the majority brain energy metabolism. Over the past two decades, the established correlation method has been successful in delineating the large-scale brain networks. However, it cannot characterize the spatial and temporal causal relations in these networks. Other methods provide some information of the causal relations, but are not successful at detecting the underlying networks. 
To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new concept named prediction correlation (p-correlation) to replace the traditional methods for estimating brain networks from rs-fMRI. In particular, the correlation between two BOLD signals is replaced by a correlation between one BOLD signal and a prediction of this signal via a causal system driven by another BOLD signal. The advantages of the p-correlation approach include that (1) it is a generalization of correlation and is able to identify previously characterized large-scale brain networks, and (2) it determines more reliable patterns of directed network connectivity, and (3) it can estimate the duration of directed interactions in brain networks.
By using p-correlation, for the first time, we are able to characterize the most and the least rapid information propagations in brain networks. For example, we found that the most rapid information flows are propagated from all other regions to the memory regions in human brain. This discovery agrees with the current understanding of brain functions at resting state, and provides novel insight into brain functions from a different dimension (e.g., the temporal scale).
In addition, a realistic simulator for BOLD signals is developed with customized selection on mathematical models of brain activity and parameters. As a result, the new simulator simplified and enhanced the existing simulators by expanding customer options, especially allowing customers to integrate different components from different simulators into a single calculation.
The structure of virus particles is central to understanding their function. Cryo electron microscopy (cryo EM) is a major experimental method for determining structure by measuring noisy randomly-oriented projection images, one image from each of 103-106 virus particles, which are then combined by reconstruction algorithms. Because each particle is individually imaged, unlike in x-ray crystallography, it is possible to gain information about the continuous heterogeneity, e.g., flexibility, of the virus particle. Symmetry is an important aspect of virus particles and our work has focused on particles with polyhedral symmetry which includes symmetry of tetrahedral, octahedral and icosahedral point groups.
Traditional methods of characterizing heterogeneity assume that each particle has the full symmetry. This is probably not realistic. We have generalized this viewpoint so that individual particles lack symmetry, but the first and second order statistics of the particles have symmetry. In other words, the symmetry appears in the expectation and the covariance, rather than in each realization, of the random process.
We represent the electron scattering intensity of the virus as a linear combination of basis functions where the coefficients are random variables. First, we derived and computed real-valued vector basis functions for square integrable functions on the surface of the sphere in 3-D where each vector basis function transforms as one of the irreducible representations of the point group symmetry. In particular, a new theorem in group representation theory was proven to guarantee the existence of such basis functions. Second, we derived conditions on the mean vector and covariance matrix of the coefficients that multiply the basis functions such that the linear combination of basis functions has the desired symmetry properties. Using this approach, we have been able to eliminate long-standing distortions in heterogeneity calculations associated with symmetry axes and demonstrate for the first time the space-varying anisotropy of the fluctuations in the virus' electron scattering intensity."

Given the broad spectrum of the issue, this study focuses on bacterial pathogens among different aspects of the food chain in the diverse State of Qatar, including animal, human and retail samples, and among conventional and organic dairies in New York State.
	Using a combination of bacterial enrichments, biochemical and agglutination tests, and molecular detection, the presence of pathogens was tested for among samples taken from farms, slaughterhouses, retail stores and restaurants and from fecal samples obtained from humans admitted to hospitals with cases of gastroenteritis in Qatar, and milk and milk filter samples from conventional and organic dairies in New York.
	Other shiga toxin-producing serotypes are becoming nearly as much of a concern as the more commonly known E. coli O157:H7. The presence of the cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) in isolates recovered from gastroenteritis cases suggests a role in the pathogenesis of the condition. Furthermore, the detection of CDT among food animal isolates along the food supply chain highlights the potential zoonotic risk. Being exposed to foodborne pathogens can increase the risk of chronic gastroenteritis sequelae, including Inflammatory Bowel Disease."			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:48Z (GMT).

In response to trauma, the body unleashes a set of coupled programs that affect the functioning of vascular, immune and autonomous nervous systems. In pathological cases, the integrated output of these programs can result in coagulopathy, systemic in- flammatory response syndrome (SIRS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and potentially even death. Nearly 35%-40% of trauma deaths occur due to uncontrolled hemorrhage resulting from trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC). TIC also plays an impor- tant role in modulating inflammation, organ dysfunction and increased susceptibility to sepsis. Clinical trials for treatment strategies targeting TIC have met with limited success. The interlinked nature of coagulant and inflammatory responses, along with patient spe- cific physiological variability, make the treatment of TIC challenging. Understanding TIC requires an integrated multi-scale modeling framework which describes the relevant bio- chemical networks within the context of the whole-body. Given the complexity and size, embedding large, non-linear models of biochemical networks into a whole body model creates a significant computational challenge.
Thus an objective of this work is to develop a framework that reduces the complexity of high-dimensional mathematical models. We apply this framework to model biochem- ical networks that are important in TIC. We first investigate the dynamics of coagulation
and understand the impact of protein C pathway on thrombin generation. Thereafter we use this reduced order modeling technique to model complement and fibrinolysis. We identify targets of therapeutic importance in complement and mechanisms that control clot degradation in fibrinolysis. We show that we can capture the dynamics of these com- plex but varied systems using the reduced order modeling framework.
In addition, we address the problem of training high-dimensional, non-linear models of biological systems. Traditional gradient based methods often fail due to convergence to a local optima or due to the lack of gradient knowledge. We present a novel optimiza- tion method that is based on evolutionary algorithms to obtain near optimal parameters within a limited number of function evaluations. We demonstrate that this method ob- tains optimal solutions on a wide array of non-linear models, faster than existing meta heuristic methods. Taken together this work provides a methodology to rapidly investi- gate complex biochemical systems by simplifying the model design and experimentation processes."			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:48Z (GMT).

I argue that philosophers have been too quick to find these concepts problematic and in need of being replaced. For example, the Liar Paradox is sometimes taken to show that the concept of truth is inconsistent, and thus unsuitable for rigorous inquiry. But I develop a solution that gives a consistent account of this concept, allowing us to retain it in spite of the paradox. I argue that when the word ‚Äòtrue‚Äô occurs in such a sentence, it undergoes a one-off aberration in its reference, failing to refer to truth. Thus, Liar sentences and their kin fail to say what they pre-theoretically appear to say. However, there is no need to conclude that these sentences are meaningless; rather, I illustrate how these sentences come very close to saying what they appear to say, in spite of the aberrations they witness.
     As with the concept of truth, intentional concepts like those of belief, meaning, and reference have been subject to skepticism and attempts at excision. I show that the content of the claim that the use of intentional concepts can be eliminated from scientific explanations depends on broader issues about how one conceives of explanations. Then I argue that intentional concepts, in particular the concept of belief, play an ineliminable role in the explanation of behavior: when we learn what someone believes, we get some information about how she would react to a variety of possible scenarios. This information that is useful in everyday life, and would be important in a science whose aim was to improve on our folk-psychological explanations. But so far, explanations that avoid talk of beliefs have failed to replicate this distinctive kind of informativeness. Thus, we have reason to think that belief-attributions are indispensable when it comes to explaining people‚Äôs behaviors, and so we have reason to retain the notion of belief."

Past research suggests products containing GE ingredients are stigmatized more heavily than non-GE products. However, given the potential of new GE foods to reduce food waste, in this paper I investigate how different information about GE foods influences consumer preferences for conventional, organic, and Non-GMO labeled snack products. Using a discrete choice survey, I ask participants to choose between two versions of the same snack product as the price varies; one of the snack products is always conventional, and the other product is USDA organic, Non-GMO certified, or both. Overall, I find that positive information about the food-waste reduction abilities of GE foods does not significantly influence a consumer‚Äôs preference for snack products.

The Sato--Tate conjecture, now a theorem, 
tells us that the angles $\theta_p =\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{a_p}{2\sqrt p}\right)$ 
are equidistributed in $[0,\pi]$ with respect to the measure 
$\frac{2}{\pi}\sin^2\theta\, d\theta$ if $E$ is non-CM
(resp.~$\frac{1}{2\pi} d \theta + \frac 1 2 \delta_{\pi/2}$ if $E$ is CM). 
In the non-CM case, Akiyama and Tanigawa conjecture that the discrepancy 
\[
	D_N = \sup_{x\in [0,\pi]} \left| \frac{1}{\pi(N)} \sum_{p\leqN} 1_{[0,x]}(\theta_p) - \int_0^x \frac{2}{\pi}\sin^2\theta\, d\theta\right| 
\]
asymptotically decays like $N^{-\frac 1 2+\epsilon}$, as is suggested by computational 
evidence and certain reasonable heuristics on the Kolmogorov--Smirnov 
statistic. This conjecture implies the Riemann hypothesis 
for all $L$-functions associated with $E$. It is natural to assume that the 
converse (``generalized Riemann hypothesis implies discrepancy estimate'') holds, 
as is suggested by analogy with Artin $L$-functions. We construct, for compact 
real tori, ``fake Satake parameters'' yielding $L$-functions which satisfy the 
generalized Riemann hypothesis, but for which the discrepancy decays like 
$N^{-\epsilon}$ for any fixed $\epsilon>0$. This provides evidence that for 
CM abelian varieties, the converse to ``Akiyama--Tanigawa conjecture implies 
generalized Riemann hypothesis'' does not follow in a straightforward way from 
the standard analytic methods. 
We also show that there are Galois representations 
$\rho\colon Gal(\overline{\mathbf{Q}} /\mathbf{Q}) \to GL_2(\mathbf{Z}_l)$, ramified at an 
arbitrarily thin (but still infinite) set of primes, whose Satake parameters 
can be made to converge at any specified rate to any fixed measure $\mu$ on 
$[0,\pi]$ for which $\cos_\ast\mu$ is absolutely continuous with bounded 
derivative."					"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:48Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This dissertation is concerned with establishing theoretical guarantees on the performance of steady-state diffusion approximations of queueing systems. We develop a modular framework based on Stein's method that allows us to establish error bounds, or convergence rates, for the approximations. We apply this framework three queueing systems: the Erlang-C, Erlang-A, and $M/Ph/n+M$ systems. 
The former two systems are simpler and allow us to showcase the full potential of the framework. Namely, we prove that both
  Wasserstein and Kolmogorov distances between the stationary
  distribution of a normalized customer count process, and that of an
  appropriately defined diffusion process decrease at a rate of
  $1/\sqrt{R}$, where $R$ is the offered load. Futhermore, these error
  bounds are \emph{universal}, valid in any load condition from
  lightly loaded to heavily loaded. For the Erlang-C model, we also show that a diffusion approximation with state-dependent diffusion coefficient can achieve a rate of convergence of $1/R$, which is an order of magnitude faster when compared to approximations with constant diffusion coefficients."

Many works on representations of pan pan girls in postwar literature and film interpret the pan pan girl as a symbol of Japan‚Äôs defeat and the trauma of the Allied Occupation. Nevertheless, these popular interpretations fail to take into account the way that the figure of the pan pan girl revealed, for both the U.S. and Japan, a tenuous politics of race and sexuality that often dismantles an accepted narrative about the Occupation and the postwar. The pan pan girl, I will argue, is a figure that acts as a point of attachment for a collective fantasy on racial and gender relations during the immediate postwar. My discursive analysis looks to explain the components of what I see as a rhetorical crossroads in the framings of sex and race not only in fictional representation, but also in the context of academic representation. An inquiry into the possibility of understanding representation beyond national concepts of the figure of the pan pan, ‚ÄúAkarui Uncanny‚Äù draws from concepts and theories in psychoanalysis, trauma studies, translation studies, and postcolonial feminist criticism to develop upon narratives and analyses of representations of postwar military prostitution.

Sedimentary environments and climate might have evolved along the growth of the orographic barrier caused by the topographic uplift as the result of the interaction between the Nazca and South America tectonic plates. This study present evidence of the history of the sedimentary environments evolution and the paleoclimate response and sensitivity of the uplift of the Andes during the Miocene to Early Pliocene.  To determine if environmental and climatic changes occurred during the geologic record three main subjects were studied: (1) The sedimentary record of three stratigraphic columns that produced a west-east profile; (2) Paleosols that were compared with the modern soils in order to establish correlations between past and modern sedimentary environment; (3) and the study of pedogenic calcium carbonates deposits through the analyses of Carbon and Oxygen stable isotope ratios. The sedimentary record exhibits an overall upward coarsening sequence that can be sub-divided in three main sedimentary cycles. These cycles are formed by alternations between sandstones and mudstones with the sandstones presenting different geometries. The paleosols identified during the field work are present across the three stratigraphic columns. Most paleosols contain pedogenic calcium carbonate and were rich in clay, silt, amnd fine sand. The last set of analyses presented by carbon and oxygen resulted with isotopic values similar to today‚Äôs rainfall values in the area for oxygen, and a consistent Œ¥13C values through time for carbon isotopes. The results from the sedimentary record represent a distributary fluvial system that has been progressing to the east that is correlated with tectonic events.  The sub-cycles are representative of the lateral migration of the fluvial system. Paleosols present similar physical and mineralogical properties compared with modern soils. The range of values of stable isotopes suggest a climate history similar as todays. The sedimentary record presents a constant or a low variable climate of the Eastern Andean belt throughout the Miocene-Early Pliocene geologic time.

In particular, it aims to mitigate barriers to the entry and realization of the full value of these technologies with two approaches.
A first approach comprises a mechanism for the participation of storage resources in the wholesale market. The mechanism delineates a regulatory framework aimed (i) to diversify the alternatives to monetize the value of storage resources through wholesale markets and (ii) to enlarge storage owners opportunities to monetize the value of their assets regardless of their merchant or regulated nature. Essential to this participation mechanism ‚Äîan open access approach to the integration of storage‚Äî is the centralized operation of the participating assets and the use of tradable electricity derivatives, referred to as financial storage rights (FSRs), to remunerate the energy arbitrage service provided by the assets. This remuneration scheme ensures the revenue adequacy of the independent system operator ‚Äîby means of a generalized simultaneous feasibility test‚Äî and brings additional value to market participants. In particular, FSRs allow market participants to hedge intertemporal price risk (i.e., profile risk) and to monetize intertemporal flexibility capabilities for improving the intraday load profile.
The second approach addresses the design of retail electricity tariffs for distribution systems with distributed energy resources (DERs) such as renewable distributed generation and energy storage. This analysis aims to shed lights on the impact of tariff structure ‚Äîparticularly dynamic pricing and connection charges‚Äî upon social welfare and the integration of DERs. In particular, this analysis presents a framework to optimize ex-ante two-part tariffs for a regulated monopolistic retailer who faces stochastic wholesale prices and fixed costs on the one hand and a stochastic demand on the other. Within this framework, the exogenous integration of DERs is addressed by characterizing their endogenous effect on optimal tariffs and on the induced welfare effects. Two DER integration models are considered: a decentralized model involving behind-the-meter DERs integrated by customers in a net metering setting, and a centralized model with retailer-integrated DERs.
This analysis shows, one the one hand, that net metering tariffs relying on price markups to maintain revenue adequacy ‚Äîwhich provide strong incentives for DER integration‚Äî entail cross-subsidies and significant consumption inefficiencies that can outweigh the social value of DERs. On the other hand, it demonstrates that net metering tariffs can achieve revenue adequacy without compromising social welfare through marginal cost pricing and higher connection charges, but these undermine the incentives to integrate distributed generation. Numerical simulations based on empirical data are presented to illustrate and validate the analysis."					"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:49Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Network analysts suggest focusing on the boundary-spanning activities of "brokers" who bridge gaps in social structure. In many contexts, however, brokers are viewed with suspicion and distrust rather than rewarded for their diversity of interests. This dissertation examines organizations in which the theoretical deck is seemingly stacked against brokerage and toward parochialism: American-Italian mafia families. Through an institutional analysis of the mafia organization, I trace how ethnic and organizational closure led marginalized actors to seek alternative paths to enrichment beyond the family-controlled networks and industries. Using a historical network data set, I document a division of network labor in which a small number of brokers - often, surprisingly, ethnic outsiders and lower-status criminals - bridged otherwise disconnected islands of criminal activity. More than coordination among elite criminals, it was entrepreneurial action by marginal and excluded actors - outsiders operating largely beyond the control of mafia organizations themselves - that generated the integrated and highly connected mafia network. This dissertation accounts for a striking historical paradox by showing how it was possible for the American Mafia to appear for all intents and purposes to be a well-organized national conspiracy even as the individual groups involved remained organizationally and geographically separate from one another.

Soybean (Glycine max) has been supported by significant scientific evidence particularly on the risk reduction of CVDs. With the aim of seeking a competitive functional soybean ingredient, a small black soybean cultivar with a green embryo commonly called Yak-Kong (YK) in Korea was chosen based on its physical characteristics and historical background and was evaluated its phenolics and their metabolites with a focus on prevention of CVDs.
	First, antioxidant activities and phenolics of YK were analyzed. In comparison to common yellow and black soybean cultivars, YK contained significantly higher concentrations of antioxidants, particularly in its seed coat. A comprehensive phenolic composition analysis revealed that proanthocyanidins and isoflavones were the major phenolic groups in YK. 	 
	Potential effect of proanthocyanidins and isoflavones on prevention of CVDs was further evaluated with their prospective metabolites using a monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion in vitro assay. The present study found that 5-(3‚Äô,4‚Äô-dihydroxyphenyl)-Œ≥-valerolactone (DHPV), one of the previously reported major human microbial metabolites of proanthocyanidins, strongly attenuated adhesion of THP-1 monocytes to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Œ±-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). DHPV downregulated TNF-Œ±-stimulated expressions of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and activation of nuclear factor-Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B), which all are associated with atherosclerosis.	
	Additionally, several hydroxylated metabolites of isoflavones in addition to their precursors were target-analyzed in the plasma of rat fed with YK embryo extract. 7,8,4‚Äô-trihydroxyisoflavone (7,8,4‚Äô-THI), a hydroxylated daidzein metabolite, was exclusively detected with the highest amount (average 5.1 ŒºM) and average 574.3 ¬± 112.8 area under the curve within 240 min. In contrast to daidzein and daidzin, 7,8,4‚Äô-THI significantly prevented adhesion of THP-1 monocytes to TNF-Œ±-stimulated HUVECs via downregulating expressions of VCAM-1, MCP-1 and phosphorylation of I Kappa B Kinase (IKK) in NF-ÔÅ´B signaling pathway.
	In sum, YK has promising potential for further development as a functional food source targeted at atherosclerosis prevention."			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:49Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

For example, kernel or SEIVE methods allow us to remove parametric assumptions on the functional form. Penalized estimators allow us to run a regression when the dimension of the data exceeds the number of observations. This dissertation presents new economic models and new estimators based on LASSO-type estimators and kernel estimators. I study their statistical properties and show how these new estimators can be applied to study specific economic problems.
The first chapter, Heterogeneous Endogenous Effects in Networks, proposes a new method to identify leaders and followers in a network. Current literature models peer effects using spatial autoregression models (SARs). SARs implicitly assume that each individual in the network has the same endogenous effects on others and conclude the key player in the network to be the one with the highest centrality. However, when some individuals are more influential than others, centrality may fail to be a good measure. I develop a SAR model that allows for individual-specific endogenous effects and propose a two-stage LASSO (2SLSS) procedure to identify influential individuals in a network. My method allows me to identify leaders and followers through their observed behaviors on the network. Under an assumption of sparsity: only a subset of individuals (which can increase with sample size $n$) is influential, I show that my 2SLSS estimator is consistent and achieves asymptotic normality. I develop robust inference including uniformly valid confidence intervals. These results also carry through to scenarios where the influential individuals are not sparse. I extend the analysis to allow for multiple types of connections (multiple networks), and I show how to use the square-root sparse group LASSO to detect which of the multiple connection types is more influential. Simulation evidence shows that my estimator has good finite sample performance. I further applied my method to the data in Banerjee et al. (2013) and my proposed procedure is able to identify leaders and effective networks.\\
The second chapter, On Testing Continuity and the Detection of Failures, propose a new estimator to detect discontinuities in the functional form. This is coauthored work with Professor Matthew Backus. Estimation of discontinuities is pervasive in applied economics: from the study of sheepskin effects to prospect theory and the bunching"" of reported income on tax returns. This salience of discontinuities makes the models that generate them empirically testable. However, detection and identification of those discontinuities typically relies on knowledge of their number, their type, their location, or their underlying functional form. We develop a nonparametric approach to the study of arbitrary discontinuities --point discontinuities as well as jump discontinuities in the nth derivative, where n = 0,1‚Ä¶ that does not require ex ante knowledge of their number or location. Our approach exploits the recent development of false discovery rate control methods for LASSO regression as proposed by G'Sell et al. (2015). This framework affords us the ability to construct valid tests for both the null of continuity as well as the significance of any particular discontinuity without the computation of nonstandard distributions. We illustrate the method with a series of Monte Carlo examples and by replicating prior work, e.g. classical regression discontinuity election study Lee (2008), Card et al. (2008) and Backus et al. (2015).
The third chapter, Local Regression Smoothers with Set Valued Outcome Data, provides statistical results on local linear regression smoothing when the outcome data is set valued and the regressors are exactly measured. This is coauthored work with Qiyu Li, Professor Ilya Molchanov and Professor Francesca Molinari. We derive the asymptotic properties of our estimator, propose a bias correction method, and adapt results from Beresteanu and Molinari (2008) to obtain point-wise confidence bands that asymptotically cover the functional of interest with probability 1-alpha. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach using a novel dataset that follows 132 patients during anti-cancer treatment."					"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:49Z (GMT).

However, there are challenges in the quality control of these products - it is necessary to ensure that nanoparticle suspensions contain particles of the appropriate size, within tolerable polydispersity, and that they maintain colloidal stability in face of potentially harsh environmental conditions. Through my doctoral research, I have developed Nanophotonic Force Microscopy, a technique for directly measuring nanoparticle interactions in the native suspension environment. This technique works by measuring the fluctuations in the intensity and position of scattered light as a nanoparticle of interest interacts with a nanophotonic optically trapping structure. In this dissertation, I demonstrate the use of Nanophotonic Force Microscopy to measure thermal energy scale interaction potentials and sub-pN scale interaction forces on dielectric and metallic nanoparticles with characteristic sizes of 50-800 nm. I then extend this technique to make simultaneous measurements of nanoparticle stability, diffusion coefficient, and sample polydispersity. This orthogonal measurement is accomplished by tracking the motion of nanoparticles in all three special dimensions as they interact with the evanescent field near an optical waveguide. This near-field interaction generates forces and results in motion in all three spatial dimensions. Along the propagation axis of the waveguide (x-direction) the nanoparticles are propelled by the optical forces which allow for a measurement of the sample polydispersity. Parallel to the plane of the waveguide and perpendicular to the optical propagation axis (y-direction) they experience an optical gradient force generated from the waveguide mode profile which confines them in a harmonic potential well, which can be used to provide a measurement of the diffusion coefficient. Normal to the surface of the waveguide (z-direction) they experience an exponential downward optical force balanced by the surface interactions that confines the particles in an asymmetric well, which is used to probe the suspension stability. The use of a waveguide integrated into a microfluidic channel allows for high throughput implementation of this technique, and the simultaneous measurement addresses several of the gaps left by current measurement technologies.			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:49Z (GMT).

gametes. This is even more complex in cases of multiple mating, such as in Drosophila melanogaster, as the presence of ejaculates from multiple males and the female‚Äôs ability to store sperm presents the opportunity for sperm competition to occur. In D. melanogaster, male- derived seminal fluid proteins are known to influence various post-mating responses in the female including sperm competition outcomes. While studies have shown that female genotype is also important for sperm competition outcome, the mechanisms underlying the female‚Äôs contribution to the success of a particular male‚Äôs sperm are less understood.
To begin to examine the female‚Äôs role in sperm competition, we took two approaches in D. melanogaster: First, we used RNAi knockdown of candidate genes to assess the impact of decreased expression of these genes on sperm competition outcomes. We found that of 29 candidate genes tested, 10 affect sperm competition outcomes when knocked down in females. Second, we used fly lines mutant for neuromodulators to assess sperm storage outcomes from two different types of males mated sequentially. We found that the neuromodulators octopamine and tyramine may influence relative sperm storage of sperm from competing males. Collectively, results from these experiments provide a clearer picture of the genes and mechanisms involved in the female control of sperm competition outcomes and sperm dynamics."

This study argues, first, that corporatism prevails in the rhetoric of the labor movement and in the industrial relations institutions while labor militancy has increased; second, corporatism in Myanmar has few historical traces but has recently been promoted primarily by the International Labour Organization (ILO); and third, while corporatism failed to bring about industrial peace, the rhetoric may limit the potential of the labor movement to develop and exercise political power by limiting unions‚Äô arena in economic concerns.			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:50Z (GMT).

However, phylogenetic trees are complex, non-Euclidean objects. While our mathematical, algorithmic, and probabilistic understanding of the behavior of trees in their metric space is mature, statistical infrastructure is relatively underdeveloped. This thesis proposes inferential and exploratory statistical methods for the analysis of tree-valued data. The inferential method is a confidence set for the Fr√©chet mean of a distribution with support on the metric space of phylogenetic trees. Two exploratory methods are proposed for visualizing collections of trees, which rely on similar tools to the confidence set procedure. Finally, some results relating to modeling estimates of trees are given, and related open problems are discussed.					"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:50Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The disease reduces yields, delays fruit ripening, reduces soluble solids and can cause irregular or undesirable flavors. One response to minimize economic losses from GLRD, is the use of virus-tested grapevines. This study constructs a cost benefit analysis of using this material in California and New York.  Benefits arise from the reduction in costs and increase in yield due to the reduction of disease prevalence from planting screened material and optimally managing the disease. Virus-tested material is available to nurseries and growers from grape centers including Foundation Plant Services in Davis, California and New York State Agriculture Experiment Station in Geneva, NY. Over the period 2006-2015 in California, estimated cumulative benefits by 2015 are $1.51 billion (2002 dollars) and cumulative costs to operate Foundation Plant Services in Davis, CA, amount to $12.9 million, a benefit to cost ratio of 117.  Projecting over the next ten years, by 2025 cumulative net benefits (benefits-costs) will reach an estimated $3.26 billion. Across the country in New York, benefits do not accrue until 2020 due to later adoption of virus-tested material. We estimate cumulative benefits reach $19.5 million and funding from the National Clean Plant Network (NCPN) to operate the grape center in Geneva, NY totals $2.7 million by 2025. Additionally, this thesis conducts a welfare analysis to determine the distribution of net benefits within California between grape producers and wine producers who purchase grapes to crush.  The results suggest that grape growers receive most benefits because supply is inelastic relative to demand.  These findings are valuable to understand the return of public and private investment in grape centers that produce virus-tested stocks for the industry, as well as help the industry understand the economic benefits of using the material, incentivizing stronger adoption.

These essays attempt to illuminate some of them. In the first essay, I discuss the three _logos_-proposals and argue that Socrates' discussion here is, in a certain sense, epistemological and not metaphysical. In the second essay, I argue that the Platonic notion of uniformity (which appears in the Dream) has not been properly appreciated, and I offer a candidate interpretation. In the third essay, I argue that the distinction between being and becoming in the Dream, and elsewhere in Plato, should be understood as a difference in kinds of predication.			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:50Z (GMT).

In light of this development, it is essential to analyze the relationship between that vulnerability and the usage of different financial services, and the reverse role of vulnerability on the take up of these services. I run a simultaneous three-stage-least square model to control for the endogeneity and identify the interplay between usage of credit, savings, and vulnerability. I find that no variable significantly influences the usage of any form of credit, which has a significant and positive impact on savings and vulnerability through loans from informal sources. I also find strong evidence of a substitution effect between taking loans from formal sources and taking loans from informal sources, since the two are asymmetrically correlated with vulnerability. External credit rationing is the most likely culprit. Additionally, I demonstrate that financial penetration does not guarantee the usage of services such as credit, and is therefore insufficient in tackling vulnerability.

Despite the growth of a substantial research program in recent decades, basic questions remain about how sexual orientation is to be defined, what causes people to have different sexual orientations, and how sexual orientation varies between individuals and across different cultures. This dissertation addresses these questions from three different directions in three papers. The first paper examines the variability of sexual orientation across different degrees of bisexuality, and asks the question of whether the degree to which one is bisexual is associated with personality traits related to sexual openness. The paper presents data from two convenience samples gathered online in the Falls of 2010 and 2011, with sexual minorities over-sampled to achieve adequate statistical power over the entire Kinsey scale distribution. Study 1 found evidence that bisexuality was associated with elevated sexual sensation seeking and sexual excitability, and Study 2 found evidence for elevated sexual curiosity, and that this association was independent of the Big Five. The second paper examines whether the developmental contexts presented by different cultures lead to outcomes in sexual orientation and gender presentation. The paper presents data from field work conducted in the summer of 2015 in Mumbai, India, in which participants from three categories of sexual and gender minorities unique to India‚Äîhijra, kothi, and panthi‚Äîwere interviewed about their sexual attractions, behavior, and gender atypicality. In addition, participants completed a computer-mediated image-rating task in which their viewing time of sexually attractive male and female swimsuit models was covertly measured. The third paper investigated whether sexual orientation ‚Äúorients‚Äù the automatic capture of covert visual attention by images of nude men and women presented briefly (100ms) in peripheral vision. Data was gathered in the Spring of 2011. The sample consisted of heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual men and women (N = 78). We found that covert attention capture reflected the sexual orientation of heterosexual and homosexual men, bisexual men and women, and homosexual men. Heterosexual women, in contrast, had their attention captured by female images, contrary to their sexual orientation.					"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:50Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This three-paper dissertation compares the effects of cutting pay and downsizing on work attitudes of remaining employees.
The studies in Paper 1 of this dissertation compare the main effects in this comparison.  The results demonstrate that employees whose pay is cut, compared to survivors of downsizing, exhibit less positive pay-related perceptions and work attitudes while they exhibit more positive job security-related perceptions.
The studies in Paper 2 identify trust in management as a moderator in this comparison.  When the level of trust in management is low, employees who had their pay cut exhibit lower levels of work attitudes than employees who survived downsizing.  When the level of trust in management is high, on the other hand, employees who had their pay cut did not exhibit lower levels of work attitudes than employees who survived downsizing.  Moreover, when the level of trust in management is high, employees whose pay is cut experience stronger perceptions of job security than those employees who survive downsizing.
Lastly, the studies in Paper 3 identify sector as a moderator in this comparison.  In the private sector, survivors of downsizing exhibited higher levels of work attitudes relative to employees whose pay was cut.  In the public sector, on the other hand, there was no significant difference in the levels of work attitudes between employees whose pay was cut and employees who survived downsizing.
The papers in this dissertation first demonstrate that cutting pay, compared to downsizing, better maintains perceptions of job security but does not as well maintain pay-related perceptions.  When work attitudes are examined, the papers overall demonstrate that downsizing better maintains work attitudes than cutting pay.  Lastly, the papers also demonstrate that pay cuts can be a more feasible alternative to downsizing in terms of maintaining work attitudes of remaining employees in the public sector and when the level of trust in management is high."			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:50Z (GMT).

The first essay, ""A Model-free Consistent Test for Structural Change in Regression Possibly with Endogeneity"", proposes a consistent test for structural change in a nonparametric times series regression model based on the Fourier transform. It is well known that structural instability leads to misleading inference and imprecise prediction of stationary time series models. I propose a model-free consistent test for structural change in regression by testing the instability of the Fourier transform of data. This novel approach avoids smoothed nonparametric estimation of the unknown regression function and so is free of the ""curse of dimensionality"" problem, especially when the dimension of regressors is high. As a result, the proposed test is asymptotically more powerful against a class of local alternatives than Vogt's (2015) nonparametric test for structural changes, which is the only consistent test for structural changes in a nonparametric regression model in the existing literature. The nonparametric tests of Hidalgo (1995) and Su and Xiao (2008) are asymptotically more powerful than the proposed test against certain smooth local alternatives, but they are not consistent tests and are asymptotically less powerful against a class of non-smooth local alternatives. Unlike the existing literature, I allow for endogenous and discrete regressors.  By using a proper choice of weighting functions for the transform parameters in the Fourier transform, I avoid numerical integration so that the test statistic is easy to compute. The test statistic has a convenient asymptotic N(0,1) distribution under the null hypothesis of no structural change and is consistent against a large class of smooth structural changes as well as abrupt structural breaks with unknown break dates. A Monte Carlo study and an empirical application show that the test performs reasonably well in finite samples.
In the second essay titled ""Consistent Testing for Structural Change in Time Series Regression Models via the Fourier Transform"", I focus on testing structural changes in a linear time series regression model via the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The intuition is straightforward: if the true model parameters are time-varying, then the conventional estimation methods like OLS or 2SLS will fail to estimate the unknown parameters consistently. The estimated residuals will contain the time-varying local feature of model parameters. The Discrete Fourier Transform of estimated residuals will contain this information and reveal it in the frequency domain. One can then infer the existence of structural changes regardless of whether they are smooth or abrupt. Compared to the existing consistent tests for structural change, my test avoids smoothed nonparametric estimation of the unknown time-varying parameters. The rate of the local alternatives that our test can detect is Root-T. Furthermore, my test is robust to unknown structural change in explanatory variables and instrumental variables, which makes the test widely applicable, especially in macroeconomic models. Simulation studies demonstrate its good finite sample performance. I apply my test to examine the stability of the hybrid New Keynesian Phillips Curve and find evidence of structural changes in 1980 to 2001 which is treated as a stable period by Zhang et al. (2008) and Hall et al. (2012).
The third essay, ""Testing Constancy of Conditional Joint Dependence"", proposes an omnibus test for the constancy of conditional joint dependence on some state variables. The test statistic is constructed by comparing the generalized conditional covariance function and the generalized unconditional covariance function. It detects if the dependence strength between any two random variables varies with a certain factor that we are interested in. I show that by using a special weighting function proposed by Szekely et al. (2007), the test statistic can be easily computed without using numerical simulation. Also by nonparametric regression, I show that the test statistic is both computationally and asymptotically invariant to possible high dimensional data. Furthermore, the test statistic is asymptotically pivotal and follows a convenient asymptotic N(0,1) distribution under the null hypothesis. I also show that the test statistic can apply to many other testing frameworks with proper transformation. A simulation study shows that the test works well in finite samples."			6/8/19		"Made available in DSpace on 2017-07-07T12:48:51Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The post-occupancy evaluation investigated the ways that spatial design of this community-based mental health facility affected perceived behavioral and psychological outcomes among providers and consumers of care. Based on the primary goals and objectives for design and construction of all Clubhouses (Clubhouse International, 2016), this project tested whether the physical environment of Fountain House supports or inhibits: sense of dignity and respect for members and staff, a non-institutional image, and social interaction among members and staff. The researcher evaluated three units ‚Äì one originally designed and built in 1965 (Communications Unit), and two units that were modified and re-purposed at the turn of the twenty first century (Wellness Center and Horticulture Unit). The researcher‚Äôs methodological processes included review of the design documents, cross-sectional analysis of survey data (n=56) and behavioral observation. The Practitioner-focused Facility Evaluation (PFE) Survey was utilized to examine the specified design intentions. Data analysis in this research suggested that the physical spaces of the units studied in this research were perceived as compatible with the initial goals and objectives of design by staff and members. The findings of the research underscored the importance of providing views to the outside in creating an attractive, de-institutionalized environment that is conducive to respecting an individual‚Äôs dignity in the context of a dense urban facility.

The province‚Äôs planners are faced with buildings that are obsolete for their original use such as cable stations and fisheries, and have turned their attention to the development of their heritage tourism industry to encourage economic stability. This thesis explores the tourism and heritage conservation renaissance through the lens of historic sites associated with the telecommunications industry, including the Cable Station in Heart‚Äôs Content, the Cable Building in Bay Roberts, and Cabot Tower at Signal Hill in St. John‚Äôs. Although the cod moratorium had grave effects on the economy and welfare of Newfoundlanders, this thesis demonstrates that it served as an impetus for historic preservation. 
This work combines historical research and primary source analysis with interviews and firsthand documentation to provide a tourism narrative for Newfoundland. It also serves to document historic telecommunications sites and their role in provincial tourism and the moratorium. The first two chapters describe the context for the study with regard to history and legislation, respectively. The third chapter illustrates the evolution of tourism over time in Newfoundland, while the final three chapters present the specific case studies."
